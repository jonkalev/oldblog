title: Does photography even matter anymore ?
---


I’ve been thinking about this question largely because my camera stayed in my little backpack on the seat of my truck for a month and I stared at it. I have picked it up taken it out of the backpack but left the lens cap on. My dog (Micco) bit the ? off so I have to order a new one and superglue it to the no longer dog bit ? . But I have not used it, while letting myself become obsessed with fences, hay, dung beetles and pastures.
Does photography really matter - fuck that's a hard question.

I remember Alec Soth asked this same question several years ago when he carried his class to a exhibit by [Joachim Schmid](http://www.lumpenfotografie.de). Schmid's work is made from foudn photographs not ones he photographs himself.

Maybe that's progress that I have found myself where he was wondering why I even bother to take photographs.
The Picture Australia archive was the example that Alec used on his blog that unfortunately no longer exists. Wait here is a [archived version](https://alecsothblog.wordpress.com/2007/08/28/why-bother/)
Access it here and search “ New South Wales police department”.
Studying these images there is a conclusion reached. An anonymous police photographer can produce as powerful a image as any professional photographer.
Vernacular photography like this is always the most powerful of imagery.

My work like most who pursue this path is plagued with self-consciousness. living in a isolated rural region of Alabama where there is no art community and the very word considered evil doesn't help.
This feeling infects you to the degree that nothing you do has meaning or is good enough.
But this I forget is what makes you have a better eye when that button is pushed. Additionally I think it helps that inner eye listen to what calls it.
Maybe that's hopeful mumbo jumbo. Maybe not.
My list (ever expanding) to remind me of why its meaningful.
