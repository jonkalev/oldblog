I’ve been thinking about this question largely because my camera stayed in my little backpack on the seat of my truck for a month and I stared at it. I have picked it up taken it out of the backpack but left the lens cap on. My dog (Micco) bit the shutter release off so I had to order a new one and superglue it to the no longer dog bit shutter release. But I have not used it, while letting myself become obsessed with fences, hay, dung beetles and pastures.

Does photography really matter - fuck that's a hard question.

I remember Alec Soth asked this same question several years ago when he carried his class to a exhibit by [Joachim Schmid](http://www.lumpenfotografie.de). Schmid's work is made from found photographs not ones he photographs himself. Soth said its unfair a anonymous police photographer can be so good. 
I dont know Soth , maybe one day I will meet him as I am a fan. But I suspect Soth is speaking to us beyond what his words mean. Hes asking us to have that same feeling so we recoginize something inside us. Like the artists that remain childlike in wonder for maximum creativity a photographer has to be immersed in moment. The rest is less importnat than what we feel and see. The power not being in a skill or piece of equipment but in the moment itself.

Maybe that's progress deciphering "sothology" but I have found myself where he was wondering why I even bother to take photographs.
The Picture Australia archive was the example that Alec used on his blog that unfortunately no longer exists. Wait here is a [archived version](https://alecsothblog.wordpress.com/2007/08/28/why-bother/)
Access it here and search “ New South Wales police department”.
Studying these images there is a conclusion reached. An anonymous police photographer can produce as powerful a image as any professional photographer.
Vernacular photography like this is always the most powerful of imagery in my mind. But I have to wonder in 1930 when these photogrpahs were tken did they relaize just how good they were and would they have ever thought they would be considered art and exhibited in other countries?

My work like most who pursue this frustrating path of documentary photography is plagued with self-consciousness. Living in a isolated rural Alabama where there is no art community and the very word considered evil among evanglicals doesn't help.
This feeling infects you to the degree that nothing you do has meaning or is good enough to your own eye.

But this I forget is what makes you better. 
Maybe that's hopeful mumbo jumbo. Maybe not.
