Welcome to my new little blog/journal its entirely open source an partially an experiment in learning jekyll, javascript and using github. As time allows I may add my older posts and repopulate it. But this system of hosting a site has no database so technicially the old cannot be imported. 

Every year at the end of guide season I go and stay a few days at the lake pictured above. Usually its already snowed a few times and it gets cold at night. 
It is an excellent place to sit by a campfire and stare at a sea of stars and collect one's thoughts.
The hard question I ask myself is under what circumstances should we step off a path? My path always seems to be veered and bent according to what others want of me.
When is it essential for our wellbeing to stop acting for others and protect yourself? 

The past year while exploring mountains and guiding ( i.e trying to not let them kill themselves ) I have have funded a fight of three different lawsuits against a newspaper I wrote for and co-owned. We were sued, not for anything I said or wrote, but for what others we interviewed did about public officials, and for victims that spoke of their experiences with courts and law enforcement. Bottom line I believed them and still do.
Thus as a matter of principle I could not takedown their stories.

Fortunately we prevailed, but I view that as a stroke of luck. Your naive if you believe there is a free press in this country and if you believe that courts at the state level are not subject to political influence and money. 
The first amendment may be something the New York Times or Washington Post can defend but its not something small local newspapers can expect to be protected. People in power who do bad things will spend lots of money to bleed journalists dry to shut them up.

But on the upside what is worth more than you can imagine is the experience of going into a fight with bullies that care less about the consitution and scraping out a win.
Its like a crash course of law school and therapy in one or getting a bloody nose and black eye but winning a fight.


I come to this mountain pictured above because it makes your mind quiet. These peaks and often frozen in summer small lake bring focus and distill your thoughts in a way no drug or temporary success can.
I'm always reoriented to my true path in these mountains.

The truth is no one else can definitively know the path we're here to walk. It’s tempting to listen — many of us long for the omnipotent other — but unless they are genuine psychics, they dont know. All others can know is their own truth, and thats only they’ve actually done the work to excavate it. Having the good sense to know that you cannot genuinely know anyone else’s is rare. 

At the heart of the struggle I have witnessed are two very different ideas of success, survival-driven and soul-driven. For survivalists, success is security, pragmatism, power over others, favorable beliefs about you by others, the importance of being well -liked then using such for material gain. 
Success is the absence of material suffering, the nourishing of the soul be damned. It is an odd and ironic thing that most of the material power in our world resides in the hands of younger souls. Still working in the egoic and material realms, they love the sensations of power and focus most of their energy on accumulation of things that have no meaning. 
Older souls not so much, they tend not to be materially driven but meaning driven. They are often ignored by the culture at large, although they really are the truest warriors.

Success is simply the completion of a soul step, however unsightly it may be. We have finished what we started when the lesson is learned. What a fear-based culture calls a wonderful opportunity may be fruitless and misguided for the soul. Staying in a passionless relationship may satisfy our need for comfort, but it may stifle the soul. Becoming a famous lawyer is only worthwhile if the soul demands it. It is an essential failure if you are called to be a monastic this time around. If you need to explore and abandon ten careers in order to stretch your soul toward its innate image, then so be it. 
For me I just like the image. Somehow as far as I go astray I find myself looking at thing and wantign to take their photograph.
Nothing has changed. So for me its time to just do that accpet that, not allow others to presure me away from that with opportunity or input.

I'm headed north in the morning, as Im going to see about spend the winter in Wyoming and work as a planner for six months.
The real word. 
At least for a whilas  prepare a application to return to school and study that self excavation thing.

And let my voice speak only through my visual work camera in hand.
