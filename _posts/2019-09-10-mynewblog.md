Welcome to my new little blog/journal its entirely open source an partially a experiment in learning jekyll and using github. As time allows I may add my older posts and repopulate it. This system of hosting a site has no database so techincially the old cannot be imported. 
The hard question I ask myself recently is under what circumstances should we step off a path? When is it essential for our wellbeing.

The truth is that no one else can definitively know the path we're here to walk. It’s tempting to listen— many of us long for the omnipotent other—but unless they are genuine psychics, they can’t know. All others can know is their own truth, and if they’ve actually done the work to excavate it. Having the good sense to know that you cannot genuinely know anyone else’s is rare. Only the individual soul knows the path it's here to walk. 

At the heart of the struggle I have witnessed are two very different ideas of success, survival-driven and soul-driven. For survivalists, success is security, pragmatism, power over others, favorable beliefs about you by others, the importance of being well -liked. 
Success is the absence of material suffering, the nourishing of the soul be damned. It is an odd and ironic thing that most of the material power in our world often resides in the hands of younger souls. Still working in the egoic and material realms, they love the sensations of power and focus most of their energy on accumulation. 
Older souls not so much, they tend not to be materially driven. They have already played the worldly game in previous lives and they search for more subtle shades of meaning in this one—authentication rather than accumulation. They are often ignored by the culture at large, although they really are the truest warriors.

A soulful notion of success rests on the actualization of our innate image. Success is simply the completion of a soul step, however unsightly it may be. We have finished what we started when the lesson is learned. What a fear-based culture calls a wonderful opportunity may be fruitless and misguided for the soul. Staying in a passionless relationship may satisfy our need for comfort, but it may stifle the soul. Becoming a famous lawyer is only worthwhile if the soul demands it. It is an essential failure if you are called to be a monastic this time around. If you need to explore and abandon ten careers in order to stretch your soul toward its innate image, then so be it. 
For me I just like the image. Somehow as far as I go astray I find myself looking at thing and wantign to take their photograph.
Nothing has changed. So for me its time to just do that accpet that, not allow others to presure me away from that with opportunity or input.
Let my voice speak only through my visual work.
