Welcome to my new little blog/journal, code wise its entirely open source an experiment in learning jekyll, javascript and using github. As time allows I may add my older posts and repopulate it. But this system of hosting a site on MIT's server has no database so technicially the old cannot be imported. 


Every year at the end of guide season I stay a few days at the lake pictured above. Usually its already snowed a few times and it gets cold at night, elevation is around 12,000 ft. 
It is a great place to sit by a campfire and stare at a sea of stars and collect one's thoughts.

The hard question I have asked myself is under what circumstances should we step off a path? My path always seems to be veered and bent according to what others want or expect of me.
When is it essential for our well-being to stop acting for others? 

The past year while working in these mountains guiding (i.e trying to not let them kill themselves) I have self-funded a fight of three different lawsuits against a newspaper I wrote for and co-owned. We were sued, not for anything I said or wrote, but for what others we interviewed did about public officials, and for victims that spoke of their experiences with courts and law enforcement. Bottom line I believed them and still do.
Thus as a matter of principle I could not takedown their stories.

Fortunately we prevailed, but I view that as a stroke of luck. Your naive if you believe there is a free press in this country and if you believe that courts at the state level are not subject to political influence and money. 
I was naive and I assumed judges would follow the rule of law and the constituion was something to protect.
The first amendment may be something the New York Times or Washington Post can defend but its not something small local newspapers can expect to be protected. People in power who do bad things will spend lots of money to bleed journalists dry to shut them up.

But on the upside what is worth more than you can imagine is the experience of going into a fight with bullies that care less about the consitution and scraping out a win.
Its like a crash course of law school and therapy or getting a bloody nose and black eye but winning the fight.

I come to this mountain pictured above because it makes my mind quiet. These peaks and often frozen in summer small lake bring focus and distill my thoughts in a way no drug or temporary success or bank account can.
I'm always reoriented to my true path in these mountains. 
They stare at me and I stare back at them.
These mountains ( maybe is a silvertonian thing) demand one's contiued personal growth that is sometimes painful, even though in the long run rewarding. 
Every year that passes you hike and climb with less strength but more knowledge. You learn to look for everything your missing that which you dont easily see.  This stripping the world away leave you whats inside you and the mountains staring back, they always know the truth and remind you of it.
That truth is no one else can definitively know the path we're here to walk. It’s tempting to listen — many of us long for the omnipotent other — but unless they are genuine psychics, they dont know. All others can know is their own truth, and thats only they’ve actually done the work to excavate it. Having the good sense to know that you cannot genuinely know anyone else’s is rare. 

At the heart of the struggle I have witnessed are two very different ideas of success, survival-driven and soul-driven. For survivalists, success is security, pragmatism, power over others, favorable beliefs about you by others, the importance of being well -liked and using such for material gain. 
Success is the absence of material suffering, the nourishing of the soul be damned. It is an odd and ironic thing that most of the material power in our world resides in the hands of younger souls. Still working in the egoic and material realms Jung describes, they love the sensations of power and focus most of their energy on accumulation of things that have no meaning. 
Older souls not so much, they tend not to be materially driven but meaning driven. They are often ignored by the culture at large, although they really are the truest warriors and most powerful artists.

Success is simply the completion of a soul step, however unsightly it may be. We have finished what we started when the lesson is learned. What a fear-based culture calls a wonderful opportunity may be fruitless and misguided for the soul. Staying in a passionless relationship may satisfy our need for comfort, but it stifles the soul. Becoming a famous lawyer is only worthwhile if the soul demands it. It is an essential failure if you are called to be a monastic this time around. If you need to explore and abandon ten careers in order to stretch your soul toward its innate image, then so be it. 

For me I just like the still iamge. Somehow as far as I go astray I find myself looking at things and wanting to take their photograph.
Nothing has changed. So for me its time to just do that accept that, not allow others to presure me away from that with opportunity.

I'm headed north in the morning, as I'm going to see about spend the winter in Wyoming as I've committed work as a planner for six months.
The real word, while I read what Jung, Freud, James and Rogers have to say about that self-excavation thing.

And let my voice speak only through my visual work, 
camera in hand. 
No newspapering.
