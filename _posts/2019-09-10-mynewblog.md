Welcome to my new little blog/journal its entirely open source an partially a experiment in learning jekyll and using github. As time allows I may add my older posts and repopulate it. This system of hosting a site has no database so technicially the old cannot be imported. 
Every eyar at the end of guide season I go and stay a few days at the lake pictured above. Usually there have been a few snows on the high peaks and it gets cold at night. 
It is a exclelent place to sit by a campfire and stare at a sea of stars at nigth and collect one's thoughts.
The hard question I ask myself is under what circumstances should we step off a path? When is it essential for our wellbeing ? The past year while exploring moutains I have fought three different lawsuits against a newspaper I wrote for and owned part of. We were sued, not for anything I said or wrote, but for what others we interviewed did about public officials and for victims that spoe of their experiences with courts and law enforcement. 
Fortunately we prevailed, but I view that as a stroke of luck. Your naive if you believe there is a free press in this country and if you believe that courts at the state level are not at times subject to political influence and money. 
The first amendment may be something the New York Times or Washington Post can defend but its not something small local newspapers can expect courts to protect.
What is worth more than you can imagine is the experience of going into a fight with bullies that care less than nothign for the consitution and surviving or scraping out a win.
Its like a crash course of laws school and therapy warped into one. 
I have learned much by watching and reading depositions that I never would have known otherwise about how systemically our system is really flawed.

I come to this mountains and have for years because they make your mind quiet. They bring focus and can distill your thoughts in a way no drug or temporary success can.
They always reorient me to my true path and that often goes against the advice of the world

The truth is no one else can definitively know the path we're here to walk. It’s tempting to listen — many of us long for the omnipotent other—but unless they are genuine psychics, they can’t know. All others can know is their own truth, and if they’ve actually done the work to excavate it. Having the good sense to know that you cannot genuinely know anyone else’s is rare. Only the individual soul knows the path it's here to walk. 

At the heart of the struggle I have witnessed are two very different ideas of success, survival-driven and soul-driven. For survivalists, success is security, pragmatism, power over others, favorable beliefs about you by others, the importance of being well -liked. 
Success is the absence of material suffering, the nourishing of the soul be damned. It is an odd and ironic thing that most of the material power in our world often resides in the hands of younger souls. Still working in the egoic and material realms, they love the sensations of power and focus most of their energy on accumulation. 
Older souls not so much, they tend not to be materially driven. They have already played the worldly game in previous lives and they search for more subtle shades of meaning in this one—authentication rather than accumulation. They are often ignored by the culture at large, although they really are the truest warriors.

A soulful notion of success rests on the actualization of our image. Success is simply the completion of a soul step, however unsightly it may be. We have finished what we started when the lesson is learned. What a fear-based culture calls a wonderful opportunity may be fruitless and misguided for the soul. Staying in a passionless relationship may satisfy our need for comfort, but it may stifle the soul. Becoming a famous lawyer is only worthwhile if the soul demands it. It is an essential failure if you are called to be a monastic this time around. If you need to explore and abandon ten careers in order to stretch your soul toward its innate image, then so be it. 
For me I just like the image. Somehow as far as I go astray I find myself looking at thing and wantign to take their photograph.
Nothing has changed. So for me its time to just do that accpet that, not allow others to presure me away from that with opportunity or input.

I'm headed north in the morning, as Im going to see about spend the winter in Wyoming and work as a planner for six months.
The real word. 
At least for a while.

And let my voice speak only through my visual work.
