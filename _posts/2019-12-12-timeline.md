Here is some data from our upcoming Beasley Hawlett episode podcast. Bill Roberts and Robbie Pelham will again be joining me to discuss the murders. Below are the routes traveled July 31 - Aug. 1 1999 that is linked to known data points of law enforcement reports, sworn witness statements and phone records.
I've linked this map back to the data that lay out the <a href="http://jonkalev.com/bh-timeline/">timeline we have constructed that can be accessed here"</a>.

The shaded area represents a estimated travel time from the last verified sighting 15 min out to potential crime scene. There a few assumptions here:
1. The last confirmed sighting at 1:21 AM is correct.
2. The time it would take to meet and have a consensual sex encounter (JB Beasley)is put at 10 minutes.
3. Time of death outside point is 2:15 am.
4. Site of car recovery is not where victims were killed.
