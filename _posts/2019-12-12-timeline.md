Here is some data from our upcoming Beasley Hawlett episode podcast. Bill Roberts and Robbie Pelham will again be joining me to discuss the murders. Below are the routes traveled July 31 - Aug. 1 1999 that is linked to known data points of law enforcement reports, sworn witness statements and phone records.
I've linked this map back to the data that lay out the <a href="http://jonkalev.com/bh-timeline/">timeline we have constructed that can be accessed here"</a>. Uncerstad this is a very rough approxmation and rough draft but I wanted to get it up for those that have been offering vlauable feedback. I'll refine this and make more user friendly as time allows.

The shaded area represents an estimated travel time from the last verified sighting (15 min out) to potential crime scene. There are a few assumptions here:
1. The last confirmed sighting at 1:21 AM is correct.
2. The time it would take to meet and have a consensual sex encounter (JB Beasley) is put at 10 minutes.
3. Time of death outside point is 2:15 am.
4. Site of car recovery is not where victims were killed.

So in other words from the 1:21am ball field sighting, if the prosecutors and police narrative is correct, then the two girls wwould have had to meet suspect Coley McCraney shortly after that sighting. They were sighted with two white males (one blond hair), then quickly departed to a secondary crime scene in the purple shaded area, had a sexual encounter, been shot, then returned to Herring avenue.
