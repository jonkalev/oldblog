Here is a map for our upcoming episode of our podcast on the murders of JB Beasley and Tracie Hawlett. Bill Roberts and Robbie Pelham will again be joining me to discuss the murders. 
<p>Below are the routes traveled July 31 - Aug. 1, 1999 linked to known data points of law enforcement reports, sworn witness statements and phone records from two payphones.
I've linked this map to the data that illustrates the <a href="http://jonkalev.com/bh-timeline/">timeline  and that can be independently accessed here"</a>. Im going to use python to analyze the data make it more user-friendly as time allows. Python allows two sets of tools for using GIS: the first is by using python scripts to control ArcGIS, the second is using native python tools. Here is a good intro <a href="http://darribas.org/gds15/"> online course at the University of Liverpool</a> covering basic use of geopandas in spatial data science with GIS, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzPSVwyP2Y0"> heres a tutorial on geopandas</a> 
As time allows I want to take a different approach and use Julia which is better. 
Consider this an experiment in process. The goal is to identify the potential area of a crime scene (assumption the girls were not killed on Herring)
<p>
The shaded area represents a theoretical crime scene area of 120 square miles based on estimated travel time from the last verified sighting (15 min out) to potential crime scene. Note: I can narrow this in the coming days with adding more data and the map will reflect that as I add it to the spreadsheets. So think fluid, i.e. dont get attached to what you see.
  <p>Data Assumptions:<p>
<ul>
  <li>The last confirmed sighting at 1:21 AM is accurate.</li>
<li>The time it would take to meet and have a consensual sex encounter (JB Beasley) is put at 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Time of death data point is 2:15 am (sourced from Dr. Wagner/pathologist).</li>
<li>Site of car recovery is not where victims were killed (evidenced from blood patterns in car trunk indicating travel after bodies were in trunk).</li>
<p>
From the 1:21 am ball field sighting, if the police narrative is correct, the two girls would have had to meet McCraney(and possibly others),assuming it was not the individuals they were seen with, immediately after that sighting. They were sighted with two white males (one blond hair), then departed to a secondary crime scene in the purple shaded area, had a sexual encounter, been shot, then returned to Herring avenue. An alternative analysis would be the sexual encounter occured prior to the 1:21 am sighting which is more statistically probable.
