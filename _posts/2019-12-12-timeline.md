Here is some data mapped for our upcoming Beasley Hawlett episode of the new podcast. Bill Roberts and Robbie Pelham will again be joining me to discuss the murders. 
<p>Below are the routes traveled July 31 - Aug. 1 1999 that is linked to known data points of law enforcement reports, sworn witness statements and phone records from payphones used.
I've linked this map to the data that illustrates the <a href="http://jonkalev.com/bh-timeline/">timeline that can be accessed here"</a>. This is a very rough draft but I wanted to get it up for those that have been offering feedback. I'll refine this and make it more user friendly as time allows in the coming days.
<p>
The purple shaded area represents a theorectical secondary crime scene based on an estimated travel time from the last verified sighting (15 min out) to potential crime scene. 
  <p>Assumptions:<p>
<ul>
  <li>The last confirmed sighting at 1:21 AM is accurate.</li>
<li>The time it would take to meet and have a consensual sex encounter (JB Beasley) is put at 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Time of death outside end point is 2:15 am (sourced from Dr. Wagner/pathologist).</li>
<li>Site of car recovery is not where victims were killed (evidenced from blood patterns in car trunk indicating travel after bodies were in trunk).</li>
<p>
So in other words from the 1:21 am ball field sighting, if the prosecutors and police narrative is correct, then the two girls would have had to meet suspect Coley McCraney (and possibly others)  shortly after that sighting. They were sighted with two white males (one blond hair), then departed to a secondary crime scene in the purple shaded area, had a sexual encounter, been shot, then returned to Herring avenue.
