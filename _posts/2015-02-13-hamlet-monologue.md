“ Police have received information that some of the milkshakes thrown today during the demonstration contained quick-drying cement” - PORTLAND OREGON POLICE DEPT.

Welcome to American politics where milkshakes are now weaponized.

I have to admit I don’t know much about “Antifa”. They seem a subject of interest on my friend’s facebook pages - which in Alabama is largely informed by Fox News. But who are they, where are they, and what are they trying to accomplish ? Regardless of whether you hate them you have to give them credit for confronting a bunch of alt-right guys called the Proud Boys with milkshakes.

I can’t believe I just wrote … milkshakes are weaponized.
