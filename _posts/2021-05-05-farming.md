I am writing again. 
The scary part is I have taken a year off during this COVID pandemic. I didn't think about how I stayed at home venturing out only to get food or medicine, minimizing human contact, like many Americans always wearing mask. I’m considered high risk due to chronic asthma as well as my mother who lives on our farm who is an 88-year-old stroke victim with congestive heart failure. Looking back over the past year it’s a miracle we didn't get the virus. 
Being 20 miles from town, there is no one to see, no sounds of humans just nature and technology /internet that is our link to the outside. Its hard to believe I spent a year raising calves occasionally hunting and long walks daily with my dogs in the woods. 

The daily routine of checking cows, many having their first calves and running fence lines gave me time to think. 
On Netflix Hulu, Epix, Showtime all I have watched any show remotely interesting. Binge-watching has become how I watch TV.
The past two months month have been even more confusing as I had surgery on my leg which has led to being in a walker.
“It's no big deal” the surgeon said, “I would do it. it won't be that bad”.
Bullshit.

<p>Mobility is something I took for granted, lose it, be unable to put your pants on or unable to get into a shower and see how you feel.

Post surgery you sit in a recliner with your leg elevated all day. Sleep comes in 10-minute intervals. The pain medication (opiates) are useless, yes they stop the pain so sleep in short intervals of 10-15 minutes become possible. But one consequence is you have the attention span of a gnat and reading is out of the question.
 You find yourself watching tv shows and then having a sense of deja vu, after checking your viewing history you realize you have already watched the show. Most of the time you have no knowledge of the plot it's just a visual experience to keep you occupied. Days drift into weeks and you cfocus on icepacks and keeping your leg elevated above your torso to precent blood clots
Eventually, you emerge from this fog of pain and numbness to learn your muscles are atrophied and mind-numbed, and the pills toosed into the garbage can.
“No big deal,” the surgeon said, “you will be fine, your young, strong…”,
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

So finally I'm walking again with a walker and can read a few sentences and attempting to write.
Yesterday I got into the tractor and made some use of myself. Below are a few pics in this field the seedbed being prepared after plowing to plant peanuts. However getting out of the tractor still requires assistance.
Its like training to be an old elderly man.

If you have read this far you have reached the limit of my attention due to pain.
At this point, I couldn't tell you what I am writing about or how I started this post.
Adios amigos.
