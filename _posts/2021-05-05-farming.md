I am blogging again. The scary part is like a lot of people I have taken a year off life during the pandemic. I didn't think about how I stayed at home venturing out only to get food or medicine, minimizing all human contact. I was considered high risk due to asthma as well as my mother who is an 88-year-old stroke victim. But looking back it’s a miracle we did not get the virus. 
 On a farm 20 miles from town, there is no one to see, no sounds of other humans just you and nature. I spent a year like this raising a crop of calves occasionally hunting and long walks in the woods. Every day checking cows having their first calves and running fence lines.
On Netflix Hulu, Epix, Showtime all I have watched any show or series remotely interesting. Binge-watching in the pandemic has become how I now watch TV.
The past two months month have been even more confusing as I had surgery on my leg which has led to the past month being in a walker.
“It's no big deal the surgeon said, I would do it. it won't be that bad”.
Bullshit.
Mobility is something I took for granted, lose it, be unable to put your pants on or get up off a toilet, or unable to get into a shower and see how you feel.
Post surgeyr you sit in a recliner with your leg elevated most of the day. Sleep is in 10-minute intervals. The pain medication they give you is useless, yes it stops the pain or better yet changes it so sleep in short intervals of 10-15 minutes is possible, but you have the attention span of a gnat. Reading is out of the question, you find yourself watching tv shows and then having a sense of deja vu, after checking the viewing history you realize you have already watched the show. Most of the time you have no knowledge of the plot it's just a visual experience to keep you occupied.
Eventually, you emerge from this fog of pain and numbness to learn your muscles are atrophied and mind-numbed, and the pills go into the garbage can.
“No big deal,” the surgeon said, “you will be fine, your young, strong…”,
Bullshit.
So finally I'm walking again albeit with a walker and can read a few sentences and attempting to write.
Yesterday I got into the tractor and made some use of myself. Below are a few pics in this field we are preparing the seedbed to plant peanuts after using what I call a bottom plow a week ago. However getting out of the tractor is a exercise in gymnastics and still requires assitance.

If you have read this far you have reached the limit of my attention due to pain.
At this point, I couldn't tell you what I am writing about or how I started this post.
So adieu.
