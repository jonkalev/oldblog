One of the most powerful tools a rancher has to improve pastures is this little creature right here, the dung beetle.
They are magnificent creatures that are increasingly being eliminated by chemicals used to treat cattle in the southern United States. I've been studying these beauties this summer and want to share a few fascinating facts about them and discuss the promise they have to combat global warming. A healthy population of dung beetles sequester carbon back into the soil, the degree of this is unknown but may have huge benefits that we dont fully understand.

 Even stranger I learned is that dung beetles have a biologically unique GPS system. The neuroanatomy of the dung beetle is fascinating.

<p>Dung beetles are unique as thy use a combination of polarized light and celestial navigation to know exactly where they are. Additionally they track the moon over its lunar cycle and use it for night-time navigation which is when they are most active in pastures. A lot of homing insects, like bees and ants, employ a long-term memory for visual landmarks to find their way home, but dung beetles however use stars and the lunar position for a type of celestial navigation that is unique. Ironically the Egyptians thought these insects (known to them as scarabs) were gods.

<p>Earlier this summer I went to central Florida to Marvel Farms - a red angus cattle operation and purchased a hundred beetles in an effort to re-establish the beetles to my pastures.
 Several things kill beetles. Most common is how we treat cattle, a commonly used medicine Ivomectin for example can eliminate beetle populations for years. There are options as to how this can be avoided which I will document this spring.
