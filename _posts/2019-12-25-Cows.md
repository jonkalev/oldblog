Christmas morning my cows get treats and a few neck rubs, especially those with fancy curls on their heads. These are a few young brangus heifers that will be bred to a brahma bull this feb - which will calve in November next year. My target calving season Nov - Dec that is tied to winter overseeding of ryegrass and use of a new varity of bahia grass - <i>riata</i> thats somewhat frost resistant, i.e. it takes a hard frost to kill it. This grass potentially extends the grazing season in lower Alabama until late November early December which would signicantly lower hay expense.
<p>
Here are a few thoughts thus far since spring, cows like these, young replacement heifers, are a minimum two year investment. You buy them after they have been weaned (600 or so pounds @ 7-8 months old) and grow them out to when they are about a year old before they are ready to be bred. Once bred they have calves 283 days later (9.5 months). That calf can be weaned, assuming their is adequate nutrition and mother is healthy, 7-8 months later, and sold for $650-750 dollars (current local market). So think about it this way, you put a hundred dollar bill on the table for two years, and you add dollars over that timeframe for hay, supplements and medicine. The hundred turns into 120 pretty quick. But then you sell a calf, and get your hundred dollar bill back and the cycle repeats itself.
<p>
You can look at this two ways. One like a poker player you have made most of your money back (except your carrying cost)  and paid for what is now a producing brood cow thats got a calf on the way. You have left a hundred and change in the pot (your stake) and your guarenteed its gonna nearly double in value if you play your cards right (no drought, no sickness, kill the calf-killer coyotes). At any point you can go home (sell the herd) and your money ahead. The longer you stay in the game the bigger your winnings.
<p> Second is the overeducated MBA/CPA approach. You have start-up capital, purchase ranch, establish herd, two years or so until calf crop is sold and then an annual income stream. Infinite variables to this way of modeling. UGA has some spreadsheets that are helpful I'll add.

My goal at Mathison's Pond is to be a low cost producer of heat and drought tolerant cattle to the southeast so I'm not interested in getting in production quickly, buy three-in-ones etc., but get cattle herds that are adapted to this specific ranch environment. 
	<p>Brangus(3/8 Brahman and 5/8 Angus) give a quality carcass via the Angus breed but with the Brahma cross adds production (12-15 year brood cow lifespan) and ability to browse forage more actively during hot weather. 
A local friend and retired cattleman George Greene who had Beefmasters for decades said he wanted "a cow that would eat briars and weeds and not hide under the shade tree during a hot summer". Thus the Brahma DNA.

Why black ? well if I had my choice I would want a tiger stripe or red but bottom line is black cows bring more money.
