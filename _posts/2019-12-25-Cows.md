Christmas morning my cows get treats and a few neck rubs. These are a few young brangus heifers that will be bred to a brahma bull this feb which will calve in November next year. My calving season Nov - Dec is tied to winter overseeding of ryegrass and use of a varity of bahia grass - <i>riata</i> thats somewhat frost resistant, it takes a hard frost to kill it. This grass extends the grazing season in lower Alabama until late November early December. 
Cows like these, young replacement heifers, are a minimum two year investment. You buy them after they have been weaned 600 or so pounds @ 7-8 months old, and grow them out to when they are about a year old before they are bred. Once bred they have calves 283 days later (9.5 months). That calf can be weaned, assuming their is adequate nutrition and mother is healthy, 7-8 months later and sold for 650-750 dollars (current local market).
Our goal is to be a low cost producer of heat and drought adapted cattle to the southeast. Brangus give us a quality carcass from the Angus breed but with the Brahma cross adds lifespan and ability to browse more actively during hot weather. 
A local friend and retired cattlman George Green who had Beefmasters for decades said he wanted a cow that would eat briars and not hide under a shade tree during a hot summer. Thus the brahma. 
Why black ? well if I had my choice I would want a tiger stripe but bottom line is black cows bring more money.
