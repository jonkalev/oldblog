After the storm.

This photo, not a particularly good one, represents much to me.
I have listened to the rantings of man all his life that has told others what to do, how to do it and been nothing but critical and controlling. 
The word “bully” is not remotely adequate.

Now I am tasked with caring for these people - the one who bullied and the one who was bullied.

I wish I could say I have anything to offer others. 
But I don’t.
I wish I could find some good in it. 
But I don’t.

In the photo above the ground is wet and muddy, water contaminated by urine and feces runs across the open ground.
There is no sunlight or new day, just mud and fog.

If there is enough ground, and rainwater, the toxic soil is diluted to a point where it nourishes new life. 

But that takes time.

Perhaps as we witness the suffering of others and more importantly confront the suffering they have caused there is hope of something brighter, clearer and less painful.

That could also well be wishful thoughts that never come true if you die before you have a chance to live.
That doesn't change the fact that there are only a finite number of moments in life.
You cannot regain those which are purposely filled with memories by others you would like to forget.

Contrary to what religions teach you stealers of life should not be forgiven.
The selfishness of those that have robbed you of life’s precious moments cannot remain unspoken.
Imagine all day long your crippled mother has one little dog beside her to support her but dozens of times a day the dog is criticized, swattwed at and ridiculed. Shes told the mutt should notbe in the house and is of no use.

How does one explain such cruelty?

All to feed their own ego so they could tell others what to do and imagine they matter more than they do. 
Very fucking sad.

The only advice I can give a young person is run as far away both physically and emotionally as you can from emotionally abusive people.
Then never come back. 

I mean never.

Count on no one to help you.
Tell them to mail you the obituary and take your time in deciding when to read it because you know it will be a lie.
In fact stare at it a while then throw it away.

All because people are scared to face the truth.

I don’t have a choice as I see my mother, bedridden from a horrible stroke for the remainder of her life. She was less important than a ball game and not important enough to be carried to a hospital until the next day.
After having a stroke.

Its all very fucking sad.
