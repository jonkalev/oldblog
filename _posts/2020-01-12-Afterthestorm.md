After the overnight storm. 
This photo, not a particularly good one, represents much.
I have listened to the rantings of man all his life that has told others what to do, how to do it and been nothing but critical and controlling. 
The word “bully” is not remotely adequate.
Now I am tasked with caring for these people - the one who bullied and the one who was bullied.

I wish I could say I have anything to offer others. 
But I don’t.
I wish I could find some good in it. 
But I don’t.
In the photo above the ground is wet and muddy, water contaminated by urine and feces runs across the open ground.
There is no sunlight or new day, just mud and fog.

If there is enough ground, and rainwater, the toxic is diluted to a point where it nourishes new life. 
But that takes time.

Perhaps as we witness the suffering of others and more importantly confront the suffering they have caused in us there is hope of something brighter, clearer and less painful moments.

That could also well be wishful thoughts that never come true. 
That doesn't change the fact that there are only a  finite number of moments life offers us.
You cannot regain those which are purposely filled with horrific memories one would do anything to forget.

The stealers of life should not be forgiven.
The selfishness of those that have robbed you of life’s precious moments cannot remain unspoken.

All to feed their own ego so could tell others what to do. Very fucking sad.

The only advice I can give a young person is run as far away both physically and emotionally as you can from emotionally abusive people.
Then never come back. I mean never.

Count on no one to help you.
Tell them to mail you the obituary and take your time in deciding when to read it because you know it will be a lie.
In fact stare at it a while then throw it away.

All because people are scared to face the truth.

I don’t have a choice as I see my mother bedridden from a horrible stroke for the remainder of her life. She was less important than a ball game and not important enough to be carried to a hospital until the next day.
After having a stroke.

Very fucking sad.

Learn what you can and distance yourself from those that do this to your family. Whatever you do DO NOT spend a life accepting it and making excuses for it.
