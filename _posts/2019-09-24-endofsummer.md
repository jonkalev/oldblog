Yesterday was officially the end of summer, my work as a guide ending for the season. Hopefully in the next few months I’ll get to explore some mountains I have yet to see and do some elk hunting. For those of you new to my journal Mavis is the name of my 31-year-old Toyota Landcruiser. Here are a few pics of her, traveling with her pulling a four-wheeler and hunting gear over mountain passes is an adventure. Any headwind reduces you to a speed of 50 mph.

An old Toyota Land cruiser is a great vehicle to do this, especially the FJ 60 model (1980-90). At night they make the perfect camping vehicle. Everything is solid, bear-proof, mechanical, predictable, easy to work on for a novice mechanic. 

What I like about the older land cruisers is the windshield is large and puts everything on display. Even at night as trucks roar by you (you’re always in the slow lane), things seem more alive.

With no air conditioning, no radio and an impatient dog you begin to appreciate things in life. Sounds and smells of the landscape are noticed. You observe America at a different level and speed. Things no longer are a quick blur. My dog rides with his head out the window and sometiems narks at elk or deer he sees or what I miss.

Importantly for a photographer you have time to slow down turn around and go back to see what you missed and photograph it.

Increasingly I noticed rural America as being abandoned as cities and suburbs continue this resource dependent death spiral. Change is unlikely. Like an addict there will have to be a bottom and crash. 
Whether life as we know it and what remains of the world’s plant and animal community will survive is doubtful. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/30/humanity-wiped-out-animals-since-1970-major-report-finds">60% of all animal species thus far have been forced into extinction since 1970 due to human activity.</a>

Driving across America at  60 miles per hour in a old land cruiser with no air conditioning and the windows down reminds me people move places for jobs, schools, a life they are brainwashed into thinking its better and bribed with paychecks. 

That is the subject of what I am going to be working on the next year while feeding cows. Rediscovering parts of the American west and south, documenting how things have changed while trying to capture the arrival of winter on this landscape. Think of it as a poor man’s version of Steinbeck’s Travels with Charley. 
I want to see things at a  slower pace and ask hard questions. 
What is this, why is it here, was it something else before, what does it mean to this place now ?  


I have not written or photographed much in many months except a few photos of my woman; I was caught up in caring for two elderly parents and trying to keep a job I have in Colorado. My mother the victim of a stroke and father fighting a losing battle against leukemia. 
South Alabama is a rough place to visit. In my case I have severe asthma and that climate is deadly, so it became time for me to be back home in the mountains for a while and have a break from what can never be fixed. 
Now I am going back to fix the unfixable.

I will say this watching one’s parents suffer on a countdown to death takes all the wind out of your soul, what creative energy one has evaporates. 

My camera was accumulating dust; I spent every day it seemed trying to figure out how to make things better in an environment that was never going to be better. Being there off and on the past as time allowed caring for them, just being present maybe meant something. 

I don’t know maybe all you do is bear witness.
