## Last night, 
we held two events in support of the project. First there was a Q&A with Adam Ferguson, an Australian photographer who shoots all over the world for The Times. A panel discussion on global migration followed, with Julian Burnside, the human rights lawyer; Professor Karen Farquharson, who researches the sociology of race and identity, and Professor Michelle Foster, the inaugural director of the Peter McMullin Center on Statelessness at Melbourne Law School.

I was part of both discussions (at the risk of talking too much), and what I found striking and encouraging was the audienceâ€™s intense interest in how journalism can be done responsibly.
