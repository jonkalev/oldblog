I've somehow spent weeks trying to understand artifical intelligence which makes for zero blog entires.
After reading a book "Synapses" - btw highly reccomend, I wanted to understand how the basics of artifical intelligence and more specifically how facial recoginition software works.

This technology is more prevalent in our lives than we realize take a simple iphone and how it uses facial recognition to enter passwords. 
In "Synapses" aside from atheism, religion, Christianity and the exploring the ideas of how all these intersect with a.i. ( I won't spoil it) is discussed in a 20 year in the future story of a minister.
This book made me aware of how little I understand artificial intelligence.

What is fascinating in 1958 the U.S. Office of Naval Research made an interesting prediction about their use of algorithms. Quoted from the.

  <div>"The Navy revealed the embryo of an electronic computer today that it expects will be able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself, and <ul>be conscious of its existence.</ul> Later perceptrons will be able to recognize people and call out their names and instantly translate speech in one language to speech and writing in another language, it was predicted.‚Äù</div>

Reread the phrase underlined in the first sentence, " be conscious of itself".
Thats the part I don't get. I get the use of algorithms, I get perceptons. I think its even fairly reasoble most people can udnerstand how these work to create a facial recogintion system. With the warning the math is way past what Fred Cutchens taught at Abbeville High School. But its doable for the average person with enough coffee.

That last sentence cuts to the chase of A.I. research. How does a machine become conscious of itself ?

Imagine for a moment I have a drone parked at my window. Each morning the drone dutifully takes off and runs a back and forth pattern across my pastures. Much like a roomba that vacumns floors. The drone relays images of the grass and creates a grid where like the pixel recogition diagrammed above it measures light reflectivity that will be used to estimate grass growth.
This is fed into a program that reads every pixel.
