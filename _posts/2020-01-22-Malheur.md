Below are some images I'm including in an exhibit "A Horse Named Hellboy"  along with notes from my sketchbook from the Malheur National Wildlife takeover that will be presented in Berlin.
There never is a right time to share your work but while reading Czech philopsoher Vilém Flusser's <a href="https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/T/bo3535843.html">"Towards a Philosopy of Photography"</a> I realized how it's become impossible to decode the American media - which has shredded the illusion of what once was an objective role.

 That's a generalization and there are exceptions but my experiences in Oregon are not just illustrative of the bias of the media, be it from liberals or conservatives, to be guided a predetermined narrative but reveal it denies them to ability to discern events by photography they are cover.
 Vilém Flusser believes "images illustrate texts in order to make them more comprehensible."
 In that sense the image is a check of the text if it reveals another version of the event.
 But in addition Flusser's two roles of the image there seems a third influence whereby the image is subsumed as meta to the narrative of the body politic becoming evidence of what is not real.
 
 The absurdity of walking next to a black man while cameras turn to avoid him bring the realization that what we see and are told is not right and the phenomena not anticipated by Flusser or Orwell. Your left with the photograph unpublished, auntaken and text unwritten/spoken narrative being true and something false legitimized by exclusion. Thats something much weirder than what Orwell imagined our future would be as it appears to be occuring unconsciously.
 
 At Malheur the photographer was subservient to the narrative, case in point apart from the bizarreness of two opposing groups of media pointing their cameras at each other and what each said being "news". Witnessing a black man walking with me pointing out how cameras of major media outlets would purposely not film or photogrpah him because the narrative was a white supremicist armed militia group - bizarrely with black people - had taken over Malheur and no one seemed to know why.
 In this instance documentary photography becomes a revolutionary act in its potential to disrupt narrative.

 Flusser's concept self destructs in competing narratives (neither being what are real on-the-ground events) when the extend to controlling what is photographed or not. His idea of a "textrology" is focused on texts becoming not comprehensible- but he not imagine that images are subjagated to give understanding to illustrate the narrative of the false. 
 The image becomes a anti-reality that makes little sense to participants of a event. These images become a metacode of chaos creating distrust and reaction to create alternative media to promote an alternative narrative.

As far as I am aware no media outlet ever took the time to visit, document this area. The cattle seen grazing in the background are the Hammonds. They were ordered by the court to pay $ 400,000 for the fire's damage, which was mainly to invasive plants and scrub junipers.  </figcaption>

Part of my film work was included in David Byars documentary film <a href="https://www.amazon.com/No-Mans-Land-Steve-Grasty/dp/B075RS7ZCY">"No Mans Land"</a>. I felt it wasn't appropriate for me to share my views as I had just sold my footage and still images to help enable the project.
 It subsequently was nominated for the Best Documentary at the Denver International Film Festival and nominated Best Documentary Feature at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2017. In 2018 Best Documentary Film at the Gasparilla International Film Festival.
 This speaks for itself and the validity Byars'narrative.
 Bayers spent years of research focused on public land-use conflicts and this film and the events at Malheur brought them together.

My experience was more personal, from meeting an FBI agent while checking intona hotel that was part of the hostage rescue team later indicted and  acquitted of lying about his role in shooting Lavoy Finnicum, to having several discussions with Finnicum the man he was accused of shooting to death. As oppossed to inquiry, I watched, listened took photos then asked occasionally for someone to expand on a idea or subject they discussed. Finnicum, a Mormon bishop and rancher was particularly interesting as he re-traced the arc of his personal beliefs as they evolved that led him to Malheur. My conversations continued with Finnicum until the day of his murder. Terri Linnel, a woman and part of the Patriot movement as well shared her history of going from a mother raising children - traditional soccer mom type to a leader in a movement that pitted her against the federal government with it drones and heavily armed tactical team.
Duane Elhmer was another example who's personal story of how his views evolved and led to him and his horse "Hellboy" led to Malheur and became armed and risking death to defend two local ranchers is fascinating. These are stories deeply American and profoundly troubling. 

Hopefully, these photos offer a glimpse into the people and their struggle outside of either of the false narratives commonly presented regarding Malheur. Whether that takeover was a legitimate protest or act of domestic terrorism ultimately will be judged by historians. The results of obtaining clemency for the Hammonds, their primary goal was successful and cannot be disputed. The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-executive-clemency-dwight-steven-hammond/">  presidents full pardon</a> claimed the legal actions by the FBI, US Attorney and a federal judge against the Hammonds "shocked the consicence" and was "grossly disproportionate to the severity of their conduct". 
 Whether one is for or against public land being used for ranching the fact remains 24 men and women paid the price of being arrested, prosecuted and serving time in jail to protest against the government demanding the Hammonds recieve clemency.
 The role of the documentary as opposed to news driven photography worth discussing.
