Below are a few images that I am including in an exhibit " a Horse Named Hellboy"  along with my notes from the Malheur National Wildlife takeover and protest.
There never is the right time to share your work but what prompted me is how it's become almost impossible to decode the American media - both right and left have shredded what once was a traditionally objective role.

 I get that's a broad generalization and there are exceptions but my experiences at Malheur I think are worth sharing.

 <figcaption> Area of the refuge that borders the Hammond's ranch where the controlled burn to control invasive plants got out of control and burned BLM land they had a grazing permit for. As far as I am aware no media outlet ever took the time to visit, document this area. The cattle seen grazing are the Hammonds, they were ordered by the court to pay $ 400,000 for the fire's damage.  </figcaption>

Further part of my film work was included in David Byars documentary film <a href="https://www.amazon.com/No-Mans-Land-Steve-Grasty/dp/B075RS7ZCY">No Mans Land"</a>. I felt it wasn't appropriate for me to share my personal views as I just sold some of my film footage and still images to enable the project.
 It subsequently was nominated for the Best Documentary at the Denver International Film Festival and nominated Best Documentary Feature at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2017. In 2018 Best Documentary Film at the Gasparilla International Film Festival.
 This speaks for itself and the validity of how Byers made the film.
 Beyers spent years focused on public land-use conflicts and this film and the events at Malheur brought them together.

My experience was much more personal from meeting an FBI agent that was part of the hostage rescue team indicted and later acquitted of lying about his role in shooting Lavoy Finnicum to meeting and having several discussions with Finnicum. Hopefully, these photos held back to give others a glimpse into the people and the struggle they embarked on whether that ultimately will be judged right or wrong by historians. The results of obtaining clemency for the Hammonds their primary goal was successful with the presidents ? pardon albeit at great cost.
