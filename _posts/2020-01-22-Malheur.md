Below are a few images from the exhibit "A Horse Named Hellboy" along with notes and drawings from the Malheur National Wildlife takeover that will be presented in Berlin.
There never is a right time to share your work but while reading Czech philopsoher Vilém Flusser's <a href="https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/T/bo3535843.html">"Towards a Philosopy of Photography"</a> I realized how it's impossible to decode American media - which has shredded any illusion of what once was an objective role.

 That's a generalization and there are exceptions but my experiences at the armed takeover of a national wildlife refuge in Oregon are illustrative of the bias of media, guided by the lens of a predetermined narrative it denies them to ability to discern the actual event.
 Vilém Flusser believes "images illustrate texts in order to make them more comprehensible."
 In that sense the image is a check of the text if it reveals another alternate deictic version of the event.
 In addition Flusser's two roles of the image there seems a third influence whereby the image is subsumed as meta to the narrative of the body politic becoming evidence of the unreal. Becoming not a metacode of text but of chaos.
 
 The absurdity of walking next to a black man while cameras turn to avoid him force realization of what we see on the news is not remotely right, the cause a phenomena not anticipated by Flusser or Orwell. Your left with the photograph unpublished, untaken and text unwritten/spoken accounts not supporting either narrative being true...but unknown. Something false legitimized by exclusion, shaping a country's opinions. Thats much weirder than what Orwell imagined our future as it appears to be unconscious. We recognize there are two opposing views but are oblivious to how the binary struggle of media narratives obscure the real.
 
 At Malheur the editorial / news photograph was subservient to narrative, case in point apart from the bizarreness of two opposing groups of media pointing their cameras at each other and what each said being "news" while the actual event participants watched twenty feet away. Witnessing a black man walking with me pointing out how cameras of media outlets would purposely not film or photograph him because the narrative of a "white supremicist armed militia group" - bizarrely with black people - had taken over Malheur and no one seemed to know why.
 In this moment documentary photography becomes a revolutionary act in its potential to disrupt false narratives and reveal the absurd.

 Flusser's concept self destructs in competing narratives (neither being what are real on-the-ground events) when the extend to controlling what is photographed or not. His idea of a "textrology" is focused on texts becoming not comprehensible- but he not imagine that images are subjagated to give understanding to illustrate the narrative of the false. 
 The image becomes a anti-reality that makes little sense to participants of a event.

 <figcaption> Area of the refuge that borders the Hammond's ranch where the controlled burn to control invasive plants got out of control and burned BLM land they had a grazing permit for. As far as I am aware no media outlet ever took the time to visit, document this area. The cattle seen grazing in the background are the Hammonds. They were ordered by the court to pay $ 400,000 for the fire's damage, which was mainly to invasive plants and scrub junipers.  </figcaption>

Part of my film work was included in David Byars documentary film <a href="https://www.amazon.com/No-Mans-Land-Steve-Grasty/dp/B075RS7ZCY">"No Mans Land"</a>. I felt it wasn't appropriate for me to share my views as I had just sold my footage and still images to help enable the project, I was just a photographer and film guy witnessing.
 It subsequently was nominated for the Best Documentary at the Denver International Film Festival and nominated Best Documentary Feature at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2017. In 2018 Best Documentary Film at the Gasparilla International Film Festival.
 This speaks for itself and the validity Byars'narrative and Im proud of my minor role in that.
 Bayers spent years of research focused on public land-use conflicts and this film and the events at Malheur brought them together.

My experience was more personal, from meeting an FBI agent while checking intona hotel that was part of the hostage rescue team later indicted and  acquitted of lying about his role in shooting Lavoy Finnicum, to having several discussions with Finnicum the man he was accused of shooting to death. As oppossed to inquiry, as a photographer I watched, listened, took photos then asked occasionally for someone to expand on a idea or subject they were discussing. Finnicum, a Mormon bishop and rancher was particularly interesting as he re-traced the arc of his personal beliefs as they evolved that led him to Malheur. My conversations continued with Finnicum until the day of his murder. Terri Linnel, a woman and leader in the Patriot movement as well shared her history of going from a mother raising children - traditional soccer mom type - to a leader in a movement that pitted her against the federal government with it drones and heavily armed tactical team.
Duane Elhmer was another example who's personal story of how his views evolved and led to him and his horse "Hellboy" led to Malheur and became armed and risking death to defend two local ranchers is fascinating. These are stories deeply American and profoundly troubling. 

Hopefully, these photos offer a glimpse into the people and their struggle outside of either of the false narratives commonly presented regarding Malheur. Whether that takeover was a legitimate protest or act of domestic terrorism ultimately will be judged by historians. The results of obtaining clemency for the Hammonds, their primary goal was successful and cannot be disputed. The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-executive-clemency-dwight-steven-hammond/">  presidents full pardon</a> claimed the legal actions by the FBI, US Attorney and a federal judge against the Hammonds "shocked the consicence" and was "grossly disproportionate to the severity of their conduct". 
 Whether one is for or against public land being used for ranching the fact remains 24 men and women paid the price of being arrested, prosecuted and serving time in jail to protest against the government demanding the Hammonds recieve clemency.
 The role of the documentary photograph as opposed to news driven photography worth discussing.
