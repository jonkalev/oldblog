Below are some images I'm including in an exhibit " A Horse Named Hellboy"  along with my personal notes from my sketchbook from the Malheur National Wildlife takeover and protest that will be presnted in Berlin.
There never is a right time to share your work but what prompted me is reading Czech philopsoher Vilém Flusser's <a href="https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/T/bo3535843.html">"Towards a Philosopy of Photography"</a> and how it's become almost impossible to decode the American media - both right and left have shredded the illusion what once was idealized as an objective neutral role.

 That's a broad generalization and there are exceptions but my experiences in Oregon at Malheur I think are worth sharing as they are illustrative of the bias of the media, be it from the left or right, to follow a predetermiend narrative.
 Vilém Flusser belives images illustrate texts in order to make them more comprehensible."
 But in addition Flusser's two roles of the image there now seems a third influence where the image is subsumed as meta to the meta-narrative of the body politic becoming evidence of what is not real.
 The absurdity of walking next to a black man while cameras turn to avoid him bring the realization that what we see and are told from either perspective is not right was not anticipated by Flusser or Orwell. Your then left with only the unpublished, untaken and unwritten/spoken narrative being true and weirdly legitimized by excluding photographs. Thats something much weirder than what Orwell imagined our future would be. 
 
 At Malheur the realm of a photographer was subservient to the narrative, case in point apart from the bizarreness of two opposing groups of media pointing their cameras at each other and what each said being "news". Witnessing a black man walking with me pointing out how cameras of major media outlets would purposely not film or photogrpah him because the narrative was a white supremicist armed militia group - bizarrely with black people - had taken over Malheur and no one seemed to know why.

 Flusser's concept self destruct in a landscape of competing narratives ( neither being what are real on the ground events) that text extends to controlling what is photographed or not. Flusser's idea of a "textrology" is focused on texts becoming not comprehensible- he never imagined that images traditionally believed to give understanding to concepts and ideas would illustrate the lack of such. The image becomes symbolic of non-neutrality or a non-reality when those that could make little sense. These become a metacode of chaos.

 <figcaption> Area of the refuge that borders the Hammond's ranch where the controlled burn to control invasive plants got out of control and burned BLM land they had a grazing permit for. As far as I am aware no media outlet ever took the time to visit, document this area. The cattle seen grazing in the background are the Hammonds. They were ordered by the court to pay $ 400,000 for the fire's damage, which was mainly to invasive plants and scrub juniper trees.  </figcaption>

Further part of my film work was included in David Byars documentary film <a href="https://www.amazon.com/No-Mans-Land-Steve-Grasty/dp/B075RS7ZCY">"No Mans Land"</a>. I felt it wasn't appropriate for me to share my personal views as I just sold my film footage and still images to help enable the project.
 It subsequently was nominated for the Best Documentary at the Denver International Film Festival and nominated Best Documentary Feature at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2017. In 2018 Best Documentary Film at the Gasparilla International Film Festival.
 This speaks for itself and the validity of how Byars'narrative made the film.
 Bayers spent years of research focused on public land-use conflicts and this film and the events at Malheur brought them together.

My experience was more personal, from meeting an FBI agent that was part of the hostage rescue team later indicted and  acquitted of lying about his role in shooting Lavoy Finnicum, to having several discussions with Finnicum the man he was accused of shooting. Hopefully, these photos give others a glimpse into the people and the struggle they embarked on. whether that ultimately will be judged right or wrong by historians. The results of obtaining clemency for the Hammonds their primary goal was successful with the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-executive-clemency-dwight-steven-hammond/">  presidents full pardon</a> that claimed the legal actions by the FBI, US Attorney and a federal judge against the Hammonds "shocked the consicence" and was "grossly disproportionate to the severity of their conduct". 
 Whether one is for or against public land being used for ranching the fact remains 24 men and women paid the price of being arrested and serving time in jail to protest against the government demanding the Hammonds recieve clemency.
