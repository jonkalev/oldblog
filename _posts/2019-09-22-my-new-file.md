## Does photography even matter ?

I’ve been thinking about this question largely because my camera stayed in my little backpack on the seat of my truck for a month. I have had few moments to glance at it, not use it, while letting myself become obsessed with fences, hay and pastures.
Does it really matter - fuck that's a hard question.

I remember Alec Soth asked this same question several years ago.
Maybe that's progress that I have found myself where he was wondering why I even bother to take photographs.
The Picture Australia archive was the example that Alec used on his blog that unfortunately no longer exists.
Access it here and search “ New South Wales police department”.
Studying these images there is a conclusion reached. An anonymous police photographer can produce as powerful a image as any professional photographer.
Vernacular photography like this is always the most powerful of imagery.

My work like most who pursue this path is plagued with self-consciousness. living in a isolated rural region of Alabama where there is no art community and the very word considered evil doesn't help.
This feeling infects you to the degree that nothing you do has meaning or is good enough.
But this I forget is what makes you have a better eye when that button is pushed. Additionally I think it helps that inner eye listen to what calls it.
Maybe that's hopeful jumbo jumbo. Maybe not.
My list to remind me of why its meaningful.
