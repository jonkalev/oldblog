If I am right about what these are, bear tracks, it looks like a larger one and a smaller one, its been probably around the turn of the century or 1920's since a bear was last seen on this place. Thats something positive to think about. I'll try to put up a game camera and see if I can feed it.
Not sure what a bear would eat this time of the year.

 On the cabin front I have the road cut in to the site. I am learning fencing this area is not for the weak. 
  I'm also reminded just how out of shape I am after working for a desk half the past year in Wyoming.
  My setup is not ideal but a few techniques that will save you some heartache and cut up hands and arms.
  I am pulling my wire tight with a Kubota RTV then tying it off on one end and making my way along the fence posts using clips. A question I got from a neighbor was why don't you hire a guy to to do all this.
Of course he hires everything done and drives a fancy truck while complaining about the price of cattle and all the payments he has to make. You get the picture.
 
  For ranching in this environment you have all the right tools to be a low-cost producer. Paying others to do work you can do yourself does'nt fit that model. Plus it beats the gym hands down. My woman has labled me as "faugly" so I figure I can cut the "fat" part of that out this way.
  More importantly on the neigbor note is if I did that it would probably mean a whole lot less to me.
  Something really meaningful is pretty damn expensive these days and hard to come by.

  One of the better videos I can recommend are by a rancher in the North Dakota badlands named Luke on youtube that has it down pat and can offer you several little techniques I can vouch for that will save you heartache.
