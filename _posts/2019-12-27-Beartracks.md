If I'm right about these tracks, it looks like a larger bear one and a smaller one. Its been probably around the turn of the century or 1920s since a bear was last seen on the place. That's something environmentally positive to think about. I'll try to put up a game camera and see if I can feed it.
Not sure what a bear would eat this time of the year. 
 But stay posted for bear updates.

 On the cabin front, I have the road cut into the site. I am learning to put up a barbwire fence is not for the weak. 
  It reminds me of just how out of shape I am after working a desk the past year in Wyoming.
 My setup is far from ideal but I've learned a few techniques that will save you some cut up hands.
  I am pulling the wire tight with a Kubota RTV then tying it off on one end and making my way along the fence posts using clips.

 A question I got from a neighbor was "why don't you hire a Mexican guy to do all this".
Of course, he hires everything done by "Mexicans" and drives a fancy truck while complaining about the price of cattle and all the payments he has to make. I'm pretty apolitical - they (politicians) are uniformly corrupt and inefficient regardless of party IMO. The sooner you learn its a process issue and not candidate or party issue the better off you will be. But this guy has Trump stickers front and rear, its so bad he quit wearing a cowboy hat for a MAGA ballcap. So I ask (naively) hows the wall going, he then goes on and one about the progress then I play really dumb and ask "won't that stop the Mexicans that do fencing"? He says "oh no Trump will make sure we have enough illegals."

<p>Bingo!
<p>
I ask him what is the advantage to having a wall and he says "keep them damn illegals out they are overrunning the country". I look around and wonder aloud where are they all hiding. 
 "Oh, I forgot they are all at your place doing fencing and ranch work".  
<p>He then has to hurry to the bank before it closes as his payment on his truck is late.
I ask if he's got enough fuel to get to town. He scowls and drives off.
You get the picture.

<p> 
  I'm not an economist by no means, and barely being able to reconcile my checkbook every month, but I don't think a good economy is everyone owing money and having to work around the clock just to make their payments. Those numbers may look good on paper and the country appear hyper-productive but that just doesn't add up to me. A strong economy should mean a community has more leisure time, increased ability to save money and gov. investments in infrastructure and quality community services.
 <p>
 On an economic note ranching in this environment has all the right conditions to be a low-cost producer. But your mindset has to be right, paying others to do work you can do yourself doesn't fit that model. Nor does making payments on 70K trucks and having a wall fetish.

   <p>
 Plus in my case there is an added bonus, it beats the gym hands down. My woman has labeled me as "faugly" so I figure I can address the "fat" part this way and avoid CrossFit (which btw is a code word for torture to men by women). So far I have not found a cure for "ugly".
  <p> Heres another thought to consider is if I hired someone to do my fencing it would probably mean a whole lot less to me.
 Something really meaningful is expensive these days and increasingly hard to come by. 
    <p>Ranching has meaning.

  For reference one of the better videos I can recommend are by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQdBK-xWtnA">a rancher in the North Dakota named Luke</a> on youtube that has it down pat and can offer you several little techniques I can vouch for that will save you some heartache.
