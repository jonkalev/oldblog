If I am right about what these are, bear tracks, looks like a larger one and a smaller one, its been probably around the turn of the century or 1920's since a bear was last seen on this place. Thats something positive to think about. I'll try to put up a game camera and see if I can feed it.
Not sure what a bear would eat this time of the year.

  Stay posted.

 On the cabin front I have the road cut in to the site. Fencing this area is not for the weak. 
  I'm reminded just how out of shape I am after working for a desk half the past year in Wyoming.
  My set up is not ideal but a work in porogress. First you have to have the right tools, then you have to have patience and understand a few techniques that will save you some heartache and cut up hands and arms.
  I am pulling the wire tight with a Kubota RTV then tying it off on one end and making my way along the fence posts using clips.

  One of the betetr set of videos I can recommend are by a rancher in the badlands named Luke on you tube that has it down pat and can offer you several little techniques that will save you alot of heartache.
