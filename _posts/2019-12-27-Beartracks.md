if I am right about what these are, bear tracks, its been probably around the turn of the century or 1920's since a bear was last on this place. Thats something environmentally positive to think about. I'll try to put up a game camera and see if I can feed it.
Not sure what a bear would eat this time of the year. Stay posted.
