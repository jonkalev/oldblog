If I'm right about what these are, bear tracks, it looks like a larger one and a smaller one. Its been probably around the turn of the century or 1920's since a bear was last seen on this place. Thats something environmentally positive to think about. I'll try to put up a game camera and see if I can feed it.
Not sure what a bear would eat this time of the year.

 On the cabin front I have the road cut in to the site. I am learning fencing this area is not for the weak. 
  I'm also reminded just how out of shape I am after working a desk the past year in Wyoming.
  My setup is far from ideal but a few techniques that will save you some heartache and cut up hands and arms.
  I am pulling wire tight with a Kubota RTV then tying it off on one end and making my way along the fence posts using clips.

  A question I got from a neighbor was "why don't you hire a mexican guy to to do all this".
Of course he hires everything done by "mexicans" and drives a fancy truck while complaining about the price of cattle and all the payments he has to make. I'm pretty apolitical - they are uniformly corrupt and inefficient regardless of party IMO. But this guy has Trump stickers front and rear. He quit wearing a cowboy hat for a MAGA ballcap. So I ask ( playing naive) hows the wall going, he then goes on and one about the progress then I play really dumb and ask "wont that stop the mexicans that do fencing"? He says "oh no Trump will make sure we have enough illegals."
I ask him what is the advantage to having a wall and he says keep them damn ilelgals out they are overrunnign the country". I look around and wonder aloud where are they all hiding. Of at your place I forgot doing fencing and doing ranch work. 
He then has to hurry to the bank before it closes his payment on his truck will be late.
I ask if hes got enough fuel to get to to town. He scowls and drives off.
You get the picture.
 
  For ranching in this environment you have all the right conditions to be a low-cost producer. But your mindset has to be right, paying others to do work you can do yourself does'nt fit that model. 
 Plus in my case there is a added bonus, it beats the gym hands down. My woman has labled me as "faugly" so I figure I can address the "fat" part this way.
  <p> Heres a another thought to consider is that if I hired someone to do my fencing it would probably mean a whole lot less to me.
  Something really meaningful is expensive these days and increasingly hard to come by.

  For reference one of the better videos I can recommend are by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQdBK-xWtnA">a rancher in the North Dakota named Luke</a> on youtube that has it down pat and can offer you several little techniques I can vouch for that will save you some heartache.
