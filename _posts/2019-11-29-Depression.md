Here are a few thoughts I will share about depression.
From the perspective of having to leave a life and career return to an isolated farm and care for two parents in hospice - I can now relate to a feeling of hopelessness and experience of depression. 
<p>
 8 months in this is what I've got to offer you.
 <p>
Daily it takes energy out of your life and erodes one’s optimism and the effect is cumulative. There is little to look forward to in this atmosphere where the only thing that eventually comes is the death of those you care for which makes anyone that looking forward to that consumed with moral guilt. 
There are no good answers when you would look forward to another’s death.
 <p>
Perhaps most harmful is it denies you the ability to think your own life has meaning, your life is put on hold or taken away from you and instead you're dealing with adult diapers, preparing meals, organizing medicines and never able to go far from those sick and bedridden. Caretaking  (end-of-life) is an extraordinarily taxing act on one’s emotional well-being, especially for this that cannot leave at the end of each day and retreat to their own home. 
There is just extended sorrow, sleep or long walks with your dog one’s only refuge.
  <p>
But what I have learned in this process and reflection on my dog walks is we each have physical needs we can agree on, food, clean water, air to breathe and shelter.
If any of this is taken we suddenly are in real trouble, quickly.
Just as needed are the things we don't often speak of when it comes to mental health.
You have to feel you belong, you have to feel like your life has a purpose, you have to know that people see you and value you.
You have to believe you have a future that makes sense.
   <p>
If this is absent then hopelessness and despair set in, which we all feel at times, and it spreads out across your life.
If you go to a psychiatrist, I have not but spent endless hours with a friend that is one that is also a neurologist and his answer is "oh you have a chemical imbalance".
But when you ask what is causing the chemical imbalance - typical answer a low level of serotonin - he will say "that's not my job that's a therapist’s job. I can just give you meds that will make you feel better".
Of course, he had the classic one-liner that "if he had to date his daughter" ( which I was at the time) he said, "he would be depressed too".
    <p>
What sticks in my mind about what the doctor said was he meant what he said and too often all the mental health care anyone receives is a pill. And disturbingly that is linked to your social status more than anything else.
     <p>
I'm a big proponent of Engel’s biopsychosocial model [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsychosocial_model]
 which believes  illness through the complex interaction of biological factors (genetic, biochemical, etc.), psychological factors (mood, personality, behavior, etc.) and social factors (cultural, familial, socioeconomic, medical, etc.) 
An excellent resource to understand why the inequities in power, money, and resources drive the inequalities in mental health is the World Health Organization's research by Sir Michael Marmot.
Addressing these needs in rural communities and understanding the social determinants is one of the reasons I wanted to become a therapist and study psychology in the first place.
Experience with isolated hospice care 24/7 is certainly a trial by fire crash course.

Of course, I am failing to answer the unasked question, what advice would I have to offer. A dog helps but outside of that I have none because there are no good options and no way to make watching those you love slowly die and suffer easier.
