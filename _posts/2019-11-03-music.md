Adolf Hitler at the Krupp factory in 1936 discussing the the sucess of germany's rapid progress in industrilization and post world war one rearmament and consequences the west would face if it led Germany into a war.
Interestingly as a seperate point, in America this video it is widely shared with subtitles that are false. In the part from 2:42 to 3:04 it is commonly quoted / subtitled as saying 'Burn me alive if I am wrong". This is false.
"Pronouce whether you hold my work to be right, whether you believe that I have worked hard, that I have taken your side throughout these years, that I have decently devoted my time to the service of this Volk."

I think any objective person would say that Farrakhan's unscripted remarks to being questioned by members of a tv show audience are dare I say thoughtful and makes anyone think diffierently about race relations in America.
  
 Farrakhan's reply to a normal educated caucasian woman that is not biased but passionate about coming togetherand finding a way is summed up in his first sentence of his reply "the desire is good but the reality is the total opposite..."
 Also nte at the 4:28 mark how a woman in the audience states in this she "thinks she hears violence". Not alkuding to any specific content (words or phrases) Farrakhan says.
