Extrapolate it to voice and think about what that could mean. Does content matter less than we assume?

Below are examples of oration that are deeply influential and not always good.

Adolf Hitler at the Krupp factory in 1936 discussing the the sucess of Germany's rapid progress in industrilization and post world war one rearmament and consequences the west would face if it led Germany into a war.
Interestingly as a seperate point, in America this video it is widely shared with subtitles that are false. In the part from 2:42 to 3:04 it is commonly quoted / subtitled as saying 'Burn me alive if I am wrong". This is false.
"Pronouce whether you hold my work to be right, whether you believe that I have worked hard, that I have taken your side throughout these years, that I have decently devoted my time to the service of this Volk." <a href="https://ia601700.us.archive.org/26/items/AdolfHitlerCollectionOfSpeeches19221945/Adolf%20Hitler%20-%20Collection%20of%20Speeches%201922-1945.pdf">[1]</a>

I think any objective person would say that Farrakhan's unscripted remarks to being questioned by members of a tv show audience are thoughtful and makes you ( if you are white ) think differently about race relations in America. And remmber Farrakham's audience is traditionally not white people. 
 <p> 
 Farrakhan's reply to a caucasian woman that is not biased but passionate about coming together and finding a way is summed up in his first sentence of his reply "the desire is good but the reality is the total opposite..." After that carefully watch the physical movements he makes and the tone of his reply. His repsonse is epic.
 Also note at the 4:28 mark how a woman in the audience states "what scares us is I thinks we hear violence". Not alluding to any specific content (words or phrases) Farrakhan says.  A very odd moment that underscores racial division. Farrakhan first attempt to respond at the 4:43 mark. Notice the polite insistance that is ignored but how in his remarks at the 5:12 mark. The response that starst at 5:54 mark remains the most concise well-spoken articulation of the psychology behind what drives many whites to discuss black violence and the underlying reason behind the woman's fear. 
 Remember this was ent unscripted and occured  on a television show in 1990.

 This is one of my personal favorite speeches of MLK about "the other America". While watching it try to listen to the sound and let your mind pay attention to how he speaks and how this oration style is coordinates precisely with phsyical movements.

<p> My all time favorite is the innaugeration speech by President Kennedy. Perhaps the bias is the actual content in this case. When JFK says "we have the power now to abolish all forms of human poverty" its painfully obvious 56 years later we have not chosen to exercise that power. 
 
 What I would like to see is if we can hook up the machine Dr. DRE  and Eminem is using to people who watch these speeches for the first time. My suspicion is there is a sound present that the actual content doesnt reveal. It would be interstign to cpkpare the brainscans of the different speeches see if there is a commonality.
