I spent yesterday at an evidentiary hearing for Coley McCraney.
Here are a few pics that give context.
The hearign was continued becuase thus far <u>the district atotnrey has refused to turn over any discovery information</u> for the case despite multiple motions by the defense team.
The 1963 Supreme court case of Brady v. Maryland requires prosecutor to turn over evidence favorable and exculpatory  to a defendant who has requested it or it is a violation of due process. Thus far the district attorney has not turned over any evidence. So the facts are very opposite ofthe frontpage headline of the local newspaper below. 


Strange is not very many blocks away these two girls were left fead in a trunk fo their car both executed. Now the question of justice some 21 years later for this little community is being asked. The larger question is how did a quiet pastor with no record of violence and an exemplary life murder these girls.
Im just watching the process with no comments at present with no opinion formed just observing but these pics hopefully give some context.
