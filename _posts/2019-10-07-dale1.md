I spent yesterday at an evidentiary hearing for Coley McCraney.
Here are a fe pics that distill the experience. 
Strange is not very many blocks away these two girls were left fead in a trunk fo their car both executed. Now the question of justice some 21 years later for this little community is being asked. The larger question is how did a quiet pastor with no record of violence and an exemplary life murder these girls.
Im just watching the process with no comments at present with no opinion formed just observing but these pics hopefully give some context.
