I spent yesterday at an evidentiary hearing for Coley McCraney, who is accused of murdering Tracie Hawlett and J.B. Beasley. The hearing was to be held as the district attorney has refused to turn over any discovery information despite multiple requests by the defense team. Such requests are governed by <a href="http://judicial.alabama.gov/docs/library/rules/CV26.pdf"> Rule 26</a> and <a href= "http://judicial.alabama.gov/docs/library/rules/CV34.pdf">Rule 34</a> of the state rules of civil procedure. 
And a famous 1963 Supreme court case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_disclosure"> Brady v. Maryland</a> requires a prosecutor to turn over evidence favorable or exculpatory to a defendant or it is a violation of due process. Thus it is hard to understand, now seven months since McCraney's arrest, why the district attorney <strong>has not turned over any discovery evidence</strong>. If there is a headline, that's it, not what's on the front page of the local newspaper.

<p>My understanding is the judge set things in motion amicably, and the district attorney is going to comply. 
But to be clear regarding the reporting, the obvious red flag is that there has been no discovery turned over, so no... <strong>McCraney is not "ready for trial"</strong>, thats comical at best. I think its also worth correcting the impression given by the reporter the girls were killed by a single 9mm handgun when in fact, the crime scene evidence revealed two separate pistols, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6463435-20191008-Firearmstest.html"> determined by shell casings recovered by the State Dept. of Forensics</a>,and one weapon fired the two slugs recovered. Maybe that's an innocent misstep, but it's important that the public not be misled as it indicates more than likely two individuals are responsible or alternatively one man with two guns, which is unlikely.

    
 
 <p> It's a strange feeling sitting in a courtroom where not many blocks away are where these two high school seniors were left dead in the trunk of a car after being executed. The looming question is, how did a quiet preacher with no criminal record and an exemplary life murder these girls. That's the allegation of the Ozark Police department and District Attorney. Pastor McCraney claims he is innocent, and many in the community believe him.
 <p>
To be clear, I'm documenting this trial as a photographer - an exhibit and photo book put on hold when McCraney was arrested in March. I have never shared my opinion as to who murdered these girls. 
My photographs and drawings hopefully give context to those not familiar with Ozark or the murders.  

<p>I also realize I have a responsibility.

<p> Given the history of local media long being advocates for prosecutors and police departments, its important a factual, objective account of this trial be available to the public. No newspaper or tv station in Dothan should be allowed to taint a jury pool in Dale county.  
 <p>
Having spent a few years researching this case, I am aware of how aggressive members of the Ozark police department can be to silence those who speak out. 
This case is important for many reasons, and I want no one to be pressured the way I was and have their family threatened.
<p>
The public has a right to know what happened to these young girls and why this case remained unsolved. Their family has a right to justice and Mr. McCraney has a right to be considered innocent until proven otherwise. And importantly, Kirke Adams (the district attorney) has a legal and moral obligation to seek the truth, even if contrary to his currently held belief, providing evidence comes forward that Mr. McCraney is innocent. 
There have been countless conspiracy theories over the years but no one, including wannabe filmmakers shamefully pointing fingers at the victim's family members and wackos filing motions in this case, have offered a credible theory that matches the evidence.
