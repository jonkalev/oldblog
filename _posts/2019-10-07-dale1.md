I spent yesterday at an evidentiary hearing for Coley McCraney whom is accused of murdering Tracie Hawlett and J.B. Beasley. The hearing was continued because the district attorney refused to turn over any discovery information despite multiple requests by the defense team. These requests are governed by <a href="http://judicial.alabama.gov/docs/library/rules/CV26.pdf"> Rule 26</a> and <a href= "http://judicial.alabama.gov/docs/library/rules/CV34.pdf">Rule 34</a> of the state rules of civil procedure. 
A 1963 Supreme court case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_disclosure"> Brady v. Maryland</a> requires a prosecutor to turn over evidence favorable orvexculpatory to a defendant or it is a violation of due process. Understand now 7 months since McCraney's arrest the district attorney <u>has not turned over any discovery / evidence</u>. The facts are very opposite of the frontpage of the local newspaper below.

<p>My understanding is the judge and both parties set things in motion amicably and the distirct attorney is going to comply as he has no option. 
 <p>
   <p>But to be clear regarding the reporter I will point out the obvious red flag that there has been no discovery turned over which is a violation of law and obviously <strong>no... McCraney is not ready for trial</strong>, thats irresponsible  and comical at best. I think its also worth correcting the impression given that the girls were killed by a single 9mm handgun when in fact the crime scene evidence revealed two separate pistols, determined by shell casings recovered by the Dept. of Forensics, and one weapon fired the two slugs recovered. Maybe thats an innocent mistep but its important that the public not be misled.
 
 <p> Its also a strange feeling sitting in a courtroom where not many blocks away is where these two girls were left dead in the trunk of a car after being executed. A good question is how did a quiet preacher with no criminal record and an exemplary life murder these girls. Thats the allegation of the Ozark Police department. Pastor McCraney claims he is innocent and many in the community believe him.
 <p>
To be clear I'm just watching and documenting this trial as a photographer - an exhibit planned on the two murders was put on hold when McCraney was arrested in March. I have never shared my opinion as to who murdered these girls. My photographs and drawimgs will hopefully can give context to those not familiar with Ozarkorthe crimes. 

<p>I also realize I have a responsibilty.

<p> Given the history of local media long being advocates for prosecutors and police departments at the expense of justice, I think its important a factual account of this trial be available to the public. No newspaper or tv station in Dothan should be allowed to taint a jury pool in Dale county withbiased reporting. 
 <p>
Having spent a few years researching the case and being sued (unsucessfully),  I am well aware of how aggresive the powers that be of Ozark can be to silence those who speak out. 
<p>
I feel this case is important for many reasons and I want no one to be pressured the way I was and have their family threatened. The public has a right to know what happened to these young girls. Their family has a right to justice and Mr. McCraney has a right to be considered innocent unless less proven otherwise. And Mr. Adams ( the district attorney) has a legal amd moral obligation to seek the truth if evidence comes forward that Mr. McCraney is innocent.

  This case has given rise to countless conspiracy theories over the years. No one I know, imcluding wannabe filmmakers and wackos filing intervening motions in this case has offered a credible theory that matches evidence that exists.
