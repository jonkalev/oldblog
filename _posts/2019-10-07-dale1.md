I spent yesterday at an evidentiary hearing for Coley McCraney that was continued.
The hearing was continued because thus far <u>the district attonrey has refused to turn over any discovery information</u> for the case despite multiple requests by the defense team. These requests are governed by <a href="http://judicial.alabama.gov/docs/library/rules/CV26.pdf"> Rule 26</a> and <a href= "http://judicial.alabama.gov/docs/library/rules/CV34.pdf">Rule 34</a> of the state rules of civil procedure. 
The 1963 Supreme court case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_disclosure"> Brady v. Maryland</a> requires a prosecutor to turn over evidence favorable and exculpatory to a defendant who has requested it or it is a violation of due process. Understand the district attorney <u>has not turned over any evidence</u>. So the facts are very opposite of the misleading frontpage headline of the local newspaper below.

<p>My understanding is after the hearing that never happened is the judge set things in motion amicably and the distirct attorney is going to comply as he really has no option. McCraney was arrested in March and denied bail in May. 
 
 <p> I also thought it strange that not many blocks away from this courthouse is where these two girls were left dead in the trunk of their car both executed. Now the question of justice some 21 years later is being asked. Another question I have is how did a quiet pastor with no criminal record and an exemplary life murder these girls. Thats the allegation of the district attorney and Ozark Police department. Pastor McCraney claims he is innocent.For over 20 years the Ozark Police department could not solve the case.
 <p>
To be clear I'm just watching and documenting the trial as a photographer - my exhibit planned on the two murders put on hold when McCraney was arrested in April and I have no opinion formed. Hopefully can give some context to those not familiar with Ozark. 
  <p>But to add clarity to a misleading newspaper reporter I will state the obvious red flag that there has been no discovery turned over which is a violation of law and obviously ...no McCraney is not ready for trial, Additionally I think its worth correcting the impression given by the Dothan Eagle that the girls were killed by a single 9mm handgun when In fact the crime scene evidence revealed two separate pistols were determined by shell casings recovered by the Dept of Forensics, one weapon fired the two slugs recovered. Maybe thats an innocent mistep by a reporter but its important that the public not be misled.
