 <p><strong>2019&nbsp; PODCAST </strong> (in progress)&nbsp; In the summer of 1999 two high school seniors, one on her seventeenth birthday, were brutally murdered and left in their car's trunk in Ozark Alabama. For over 20 years the case remained unsolved fueling rumours and conspiracy theories of a cover-up. In 2017 an aux. police officer claimed a former officer was responsible. The Attorney General then appointed a special cold case investigator and a retired state law enforcement official that had quietly worked the case for years shared documents that were never shared with the FBI that support the officer's claim. 
 <P>In 2019 however an arrest was made of a preacher who's DNA matched semen found on one of the girls, there was no evidence of rape only consensual sex. Part photo-exhibit and filmed interviews, this work examines the emotional trauma unsolved murders can have on a small town. It is a rare glimpse behind the scenes of a homicide investigation into two heinous murders for over 20 years.

<p><strong> 2017&nbsp; NO MANS LAND </strong>&nbsp;This was my first opportunity to film part of a documentary. Directed by David Byars, No Mans Land is an on-the-ground account of the 2016 standoff between protestors of a ranching family's conflict over grazing rights and the occupation of Oregon's Malheur National Wildlife Refuge and federal authorities during a 41-day siege. It documents the occupation from inception to demise and tells the story of those on the inside of this movement. Watch the trailer below.

PBS - Independent Lens recently aired a special "Return to Malheur" that contains previously unpublished footage and is valuable in understanding the continued conflict over grazing rights on public land.

 <p> This work served is my graduate thesis at Auburn University examining how the physical form of landscape in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Belt_(region_of_Alabama">the Black Belt region of Alabama</a></em> reinforces racism. It is my assertion this landscape creates a negative value of "civic equality‚Äù, where and how racial conflict occurs was documented by video, photographs and drawings. Communities are segregated according to race, civic space often anchored by confederate monuments and compositions of towns deny one race economic participation.  The research reveals two different psychological spaces emerge from a singular landscape. This dynamic reinforces racism and acceptance of segregation being a hidden transcript contributing to racial conflict.
