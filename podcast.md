 <P><strong><a href="http://www.yahoo.com">EPISODE 1:&nbsp; THE MURDERS OF JB BEASLEY AND TRACIE HAWLETT</a> </strong>&nbsp; In the summer of 1999 two high school seniors, one on her seventeenth birthday, were brutally murdered and left in their car's trunk in Ozark Alabama. For over 20 years the case remained unsolved fueling rumours and conspiracy theories of a cover-up. In 2017 an aux. police officer claimed a former officer was responsible. The Attorney General then appointed a special cold case investigator and a retired state law enforcement official that had quietly worked the case for years shared documents that were never shared with the FBI that support the officer's claim. 
 <P>In 2019 however an arrest was made of a preacher who's DNA matched semen found on one of the girls, there was no evidence of rape only consensual sex. The episodes ( 4) of the podcast that covers these murders will present a series of facts and a timeline we will post on this site so our listeners can follow the discussions.
  <p>
  It will a rare glimpse behind the scenes of a homicide investigation into two heinous murders for over 20 years.
