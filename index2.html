	<i>"EVERY SUNDAY WHEN WE GO TO CHURCH MY MOMMA GETS PULLED OVER BY THE SAME WHITE COP. HE ASKS THE SAME QUESTIONS MAKES HER STAND UP AND PUT HIS HANDS ON HER. SHE CAN'T TELL MY DADDY. GOD HELP US CUZ LIFE HERE IS LIKE HELL".</i>
	
<p>Along the border of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Belt_(region_of_Alabama)"/>the black belt region</a> is Alabama's twentieth judicial district. Documented being one of the nation's most corrupt (see <a href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/blog/measuring-illegal-and-legal-corruption-american-states-some-results-safra/">Harvardâ€™s Edward Safra Center for Government Ethics study</a>) judicial systems, it's physical landscape serves as an "ecotone" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecotone] where poor whites historically competed with freed slaves / black sharecroppers for seasonal labor picking cotton and formed community in a heightened state of tension.
	<p>
		The physical form of this community becomes a hidden transcript of race.
	 WEB Dubois observed this area as having a color line being invisible but physical phenomena ( see 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Souls_of_Black_Folk"/>Souls of Black Folks</a>).
The area remains one of the most ethnically segregated landscapes in North America. One that has a high concentration of white supremacists in positions of local government. The built space and urban form of the community reinforce and perpetuate embedded racism.
<p>
	 I explored the influence of racism both in whites and blacks photographing conflict across the racial lines and distrust in local government and inequities in the judicial system.
