	<i>"EVERY SUNDAY WHEN WE GO TO CHURCH MY MOMMA GETS PULLED OVER BY THE SAME WHITE COP. HE ASKS THE SAME QUESTIONS MAKES HER STAND UP AND PUT HIS HANDS ON HER. SHE CAN'T TELL MY DADDY. GOD HELP US CUZ LIFE HERE IS LIKE HELL".</i>
	

	<p>Along the southern border of the black belt region is Alabama's twentieth judicial district. Known for being one of the nation's most corrupt (see <a href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/blog/measuring-illegal-and-legal-corruption-american-states-some-results-safra/">Harvardâ€™s Edward Safra Center for Government Ethics</a>), it serves as an ecological edge where poor whites competed with freed slaves / black sharecroppers for seasonal labor picking cotton.
		The area remains one of the most ethnically segregated landscapes in North America. One that has a high concentration of white supremacist that are accepted in positions of local goverment.
		Presented with this landscape I explored how segregated spaces influence racism both in whites and blacks creating mutual distrust and resentment.
