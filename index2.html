	<p>Along the border of the black belt region [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Belt_(region_of_Alabama ] is Alabama's twentieth judicial district. Documented being one of the nation's most corrupt (see <a href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/blog/measuring-illegal-and-legal-corruption-american-states-some-results-safra/">Harvardâ€™s Edward Safra Center for Government Ethics</a>)judical systems, it's physical landscape serves as an "ecotone" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecotone] where poor whites competed with freed slaves / black sharecroppers for seasonal labor picking cotton and formed community in a heightened state of tension.  
		The physical form of this comunity amounts to a hidden transcript of race.
		WEB Dubois observed this area as having a color line being invisible but a physical phenomena [1] 
		Souls of Black Folks [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Souls_of_Black_Folk ]
		
		The area remains one of the most ethnically segregated landscapes in North America. One that has a high concentration of white supremacists in positions of local goverment. The built space and urban form of the community reinforces and perpetuates an embedded racism.
		I explored the influence racism both in whites and blacks photographing conflict across the racial lines and in distrust inlocal government and the judicial system.
