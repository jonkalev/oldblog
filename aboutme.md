<p> <strong>Multidisciplinary visual artist and rancher</strong>.
  <p>
    I never thought I would be a rancher, even though my grandfather was a cattleman, as was his, and his father before him.  
    When life and education led me down the soulless path I changed course and bought my family's ranch.  <p>
    Ranching requires days on end working in solitude.
    It is hard, physical work that connects you to the land, in that connection though is a sublime beauty. I write about these experiences on my blog.
      
      
  My choice to pick up a camera came after having a brain anneursym and stroke. In the process of recovering I saw what can best be described as compositions in images before I had never seen before, compelling me to photograph them.
