<strong>Statement</strong>
<p>My interest as a photographer is trying to understand cultural landscapes and the influence of resultant physical form. I am self-taught, introduced to the medium while completing my graduate thesis at Auburn University and studying the works of J.B. Jackson. Photography over time of the same landscapes shows how physical form (the built environment) responds to culture and resource exploitation as well as reveal the effect resultant form has on those living there.

<p>l am still learning to understand the basics of exposure aperture and lens selection. Sometimes I like to film people discussing their experience of place or conflict. Te moving image is more a combination of audio and image in my work less something new.  My inspirations are Walker Evans, Robert Capa, and William Allard.

<strong>Equipment</strong> 
 <p>I use the Fuji XPro, XT 2, and their fixed x series lenses. Fuji’s system is small weatherproof and durable. Summers I work as a mountain guide in the San Juan mountains between 10 and 14 thousand feet in elevation so my system must fit in my backpack, be lightweight and work in any condition.
Digitally I keep things minimal using only a Ipad pro, editing kept to a minimum with Lightroom. With the iPad I use open source software, Jekyll and Github to maintain this page. The core idea is be mobile and self reliant, not needing electricity except what a backpack based solar unit can provide avoiding the use of a laptop or desktop machine.
