<strong><i>The dark space is ranching, ranching's realm is really then, definable as where most people are absent.</i>
Paul Stars</strong>

<p> Multidisciplinary visual artist and rancher.
  <p>
    Not sure I ever thought I would grow up to be a rancher, my grandfather was a cattleman, as was his and father before him.   So its defintiely hardwired into my dna.  
    Just when your life and education lead you in ways that seem meaningless I decided to change course and buy my family's ranch. <p>
    Ranching requires days on end working in solitude.
    It is hard physical work that deeply connects you to the landscape. But in that connection is a sublime beauty. I try to write about these experiences and photograph my community.

 <p>Equipment used is a Fuji XPro2 (stills) and XT-3 (video) along with <a href="https://www.fujifilmusa.com/products/digital_cameras/x-lenses/">their fixed x series lenses- 16/23/35/56</a>. Fuji’s system is small weatherproof and very durable. It's sensor captures a gorgeous spectrum of color.  
   Seasonally ( June-August) I work as a mountain guide<a href="https://www.sanjuanbackcountry.com"> (click to book a trip) </a> in the wilderness of the San Juan mountains of Colorado between 10 and 14 thousand feet in elevation so my camera must fit in a backpack, be lightweight and work in any weather condition. 
Digitally I keep things minimal using an iPad pro, editing kept to a minimum. With the iPad I've found I can use open source software, Jekyll and Github to maintain this page to record my ideas. The core idea is mobile and self reliant, not needing electricity except what a backpack based solar unit can provide and avoid the use of a laptop or desktop. If I can't do all I need to do on the hood of my truck then it does'nt work.
