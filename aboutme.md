<strong>Artist Statement</strong>
<p>I am a graduate student studying clinical psychology with the goal of developing a practice using wilderness and visual art therapy. 
  My passion is documentary photography and film, I'm particularly interested in how landscapes influecne how people think and behave. I use photography to document cultural landscapes and the resultant physical form. I am a self-taught, introduced to the medium while in graduate school and studying the works of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Jackson">J.B. Jackson</a>. I believe photography and drawings of landscapes reveal how physical form (the built environment) is driven by culture as well as reveal the influence resultant form has on inhabitants.
  Resource exploitation, racial segregation, and a materially obsessed capitalist culture all become self-fulfilling prophecies their built form steering culture in  what I term a psychology of landscape.

<p>Some of my inspirations are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Evans">Walker Evans</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Capa">Robert Capa</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Arbus">Diane Arbus</a> and <a href="https://www.williamalbertallard.com/">William Allard</a>.

<strong>Equipment</strong> 
 <p>I use the Fuji XPro and <a href="https://www.fujifilmusa.com/products/digital_cameras/x-lenses/">their fixed x series lenses- 16/23/35/56</a>. Fuji’s system is small weatherproof and very durable. It's sensor captures a gorgeous spectrum of color.  
   Seasonally I work as a mountain guide in the San Juan mountains of Colorado between 10 and 14 thousand feet in elevation so my camera must fit in a backpack, be lightweight and work in any weather condition. Also critical the Fuji system is very usable by horseback.
Digitally I keep things minimal using an iPad pro, editing kept to a minimum with Lightroom. With the iPad I've found I can use open source software, Jekyll and Github to maintain this page to record my ideas. The core idea is be mobile and self reliant, not needing electricity except what a backpack based solar unit can provide and avoid the use of a laptop or desktop. If I can't do all I need to do on the hood of my truck or trail then it doesnt work.
