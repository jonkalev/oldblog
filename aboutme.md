<p> <strong>Photographer and rancher</strong>.
  <p>
    I never thought I would be a rancher, even though my grandfather was a cattleman, as was his, and his father before him.  
    After two plus decades of practicing architecture and planning at the age of 54 I retired and bought my family's ranch.  <p>
    Ranching requires days on end working in solitude. In all honesty I work harder now then when I worked a real job. Instead of a computer screen and mediatign endless dsputes between those seeking to develop a landscape and those seeking to preserve it I listen to silence and watch a blue sky and thunderstroms roll in from the Gulf of Mexico in the afternoons.
    Make no mistake it is hard, physical work but it connects one to the land, in that connection is a sublime beauty. On this blog I write about these experiences.
      
      
  My choice to pick up a camera came after having taken a year sabbatical working as an alpine guide in the San Juan mountains of southwest Colorado. In the process of recovery from the "real world" I saw what can best be described as a community formed of a geology and geography as opposed to the traditiponal view of man imposing his will upon a landscape. Forests became less a vista or scenic experience and more a host organism.
<p>
  I'm always interested in developing compelling content, especially if its portraiture, storytelling or related to rural culture and their respective landscapes. Always open to ideas and dialogue. I work alone, natural light, little or no editing, minimalist approach. One camera, a fuji xpro-3 and three fixed lenses, 16, 35, and 50.
  
  I make no effort to market myself, no cold calls, no promos, etc. just word of mouth or if you stumble upon this site or my instagram account.
