<p> My primary interest as a documentary photogrpaher is cultural landscapes and examining the physical form of ethnic and religous segregation. I am self taught and became fascinated with the medium while completing my graduate thesis at Auburn University and studying the works of J.B. Jackson.

In 2016 I filmed several interviews in  “No Man’s Land” a documentary about the armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Burns Oregon to protest a ranching family’s incarcration. The film was nominated for the Best Documentary at the Denver International Film Festival 2017, and nominated Best Documentary Feature at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2017. It was awarded the Best Documentary Film at the Gasparilla International Film Festival in 2018.
