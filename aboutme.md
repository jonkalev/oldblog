<strong><i>The dark space is ranching, ranching's realm is really then, definable as where most people are absent.</i></strong>
<p> <strong>Paul Stars</strong>

<p> Multidisciplinary visual artist and rancher.
  <p>
    Not sure I ever thought I would grow up to be a rancher, my grandfather was a cattleman, as was his and father before him.   So its defintiely hardwired into my dna.  
    When my life and education lead you in ways that are soulless I changed course and bought my family's ranch.  <p>
    Ranching requires days on end working in solitude.
    It is hard physical work that deeply connects you to the landscape. But in that connection is a sublime beauty. I try to write about these experiences and photograph my community.
   I write about my experiences on my blog and medium.
