<strong>Artist Statement</strong>
<p>I'm a graduate student studying social psychology with the long term goal of developing a wilderness therapy practice. 
  My artistic passion is documentary photography, which I use to document how landscapes influence social judgment, motivation, and behavior. A visual analysis offers understanding of cultural landscapes and how the resultant physical form can determine social goals and political attitudes are influenced by the underlying physical-level experience.
  Specifically I am interested in researching ethnically segregated communities by investigating interactions between intrapersonal processes (e.g., emotion, social cognition, motivation, attitudes, and belief systems) and social behavior (e.g., persuasion, communication, decision making, stereotyping, political behavior, health behavior, and intergroup cooperation or conflict) in the American South.  
  
  <p>I am a self-taught photographer, introduced to the medium while in graduate school and studying the works of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Jackson">J.B. Jackson</a>. 

<p>Some of my inspirations from psychology are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Lacan">Jaques Lacan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Rogers">Carl Rogers</a> Seligman's <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-sze/the-father-of-positive-ps_b_7600226.html">Perma model</a> and photographers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Evans">Walker Evans</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Capa">Robert Capa</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Arbus">Diane Arbus</a> and <a href="https://www.williamalbertallard.com/">William Allard</a>.

<strong>Equipment</strong> 
 <p>I use the Fuji XPro2(stills) and XT-3(video) and <a href="https://www.fujifilmusa.com/products/digital_cameras/x-lenses/">their fixed x series lenses- 16/23/35/56</a>. Fuji’s system is small weatherproof and very durable. It's sensor captures a gorgeous spectrum of color.  
   Seasonally I work as a mountain guide in the San Juan mountains of Colorado between 10 and 14 thousand feet in elevation so my camera must fit in a backpack, be lightweight and work in any weather condition. Also critical the Fuji system is very usable by horseback.
Digitally I keep things minimal using an iPad pro, editing kept to a minimum. With the iPad I've found I can use open source software, Jekyll and Github to maintain this page to record my ideas. The core idea is mobile and self reliant, not needing electricity except what a backpack based solar unit can provide and avoid the use of a laptop or desktop. If I can't do all I need to do on the hood of my truck then it does'nt work.

<strong>Recent work</strong>
  <p>In 2016 I filmed part of <a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/no-mans-land-trailer-yuftvd/">“No Man’s Land”</a> a documentary about the armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon to protest a ranching family’s incarceration. The film was nominated for the Best Documentary at the Denver International Film Festival and nominated Best Documentary Feature at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2017. It was awarded the Best Documentary Film at the Gasparilla International Film Festival in 2018. 
    
<p>In 2014 I was awarded the Zilphea Horton Grant by the <a href="https://www.highlandercenter.org">Highlander Foundation</a>. 
  This was used to research and <a href="https://medium.com/@jonbcarroll/leaked-documents-reveal-dothan-police-department-alleged-to-have-planted-drugs-f89109dc196e"> document victims</a> in a community ranked by Harvard's Center for Government Ethics as one of the most corrupt in the nation - Alabama’s 20th judicial district. A book of these photographs, “Save the Kennys” is forthcoming.
<p>
From 2013 TO 2015 I wrote a weekly op-ed and served as a photographer for a small community newspaper.
