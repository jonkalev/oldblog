<p> <strong>Photographer and rancher</strong>.
  <p>
    I never thought I would be a rancher, even though my grandfather was a cattleman, as was his, and his father before him.  
    When life and education led me down the soulless path I changed course and bought my family's ranch.  <p>
    Ranching requires days on end working in solitude.
    It is hard, physical work that connects you to the land, in that connection though is a sublime beauty. I write about these experiences.
      
      
  My choice to pick up a camera came after having a brain anneursym and stroke. In the process of recovery I saw what can best be described as compositions in what I saw in my vision I had never seen, compelling me to photograph them. 
<p>
  I'm always interested in developing compelling content, especially if its portraiture, storytelling or related to  rural life and their landscapes. Always open to ideas. I work alone, natural light, little or no editing, minimalist approach. 
  
  I make no effort to market myself, no cold calls, no promos, etc. just word of mouth or if you stumble upon this site or my instagram account.
