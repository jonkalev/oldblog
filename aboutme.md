<blockquote>The dark space is ranching, ranching's realm is really then, definable as where most people are absent.
<p>-Paul F. Starrs</blockquote>

<p> <strong>Multidisciplinary visual artist and rancher</strong>.
  <p>
    I never thought I would be a rancher, even though my grandfather was a cattleman, as was his, and his father before him.  
    When my life and education led me to the soulless path I changed course and bought my family's ranch.  <p>
    Ranching requires days on end working in solitude.
    It is hard, physical work that connects you to the land, in that connection is sublime beauty. I write about these experiences and photograph them.
