<strong>Artist Statement</strong>
<p>My interest as a photographer is trying to understand cultural landscapes and influence of resultant physical form. I am self-taught, introduced to the medium while in graduate school and studying the works of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Jackson">J.B. Jackson</a>. Photography over time of landscapes can reveal how physical form (the built environment) responds to culture and resource exploitation as well as reveal the effect resultant form has on those living there.

<p>l am still a beginner to photogrpahy, learning to understand the basics of exposure aperture and lens selection. Sometimes I like to film people discussing their experience of place or conflict. The moving image is a combination of audio and image in my work less something new.  Some of my inspirations are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Evans">Walker Evans</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Capa">Robert Capa</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Arbus">Diane Arbus</a> and <a href="https://www.williamalbertallard.com/">William Allard</a>.

<strong>Equipment</strong> 
 <p>I use the Fuji XPro, XT 2, and <a href="https://www.fujifilmusa.com/products/digital_cameras/x-lenses/">their fixed x series lenses- 16/23/35/56</a> Fuji’s system is small weatherproof and very durable. Summers I work as a mountain guide in the San Juan mountains between 10 and 14 thousand feet in elevation so my camera must fit in my backpack, be lightweight and work in any weather condition.
Digitally I keep things minimal using only an iPad pro, editing kept to a minimum with Lightroom. With the iPad I've found I can use open source software, Jekyll and Github to maintain this page. The core idea is be mobile and self reliant, not needing electricity except what a backpack based solar unit can provide and avoid the use of a laptop or desktop machine. If I cant do all I need to do in my truck or on the trail then it doesnt work for me.
