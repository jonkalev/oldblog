<strong>Artist Statement</strong>
<p>My curiosity is trying to understand cultural landscapes and the resultant physical form. I am a self-taught photographer, introduced to the medium while in graduate school and studying the works of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Jackson">J.B. Jackson</a>. I believe photography and drawings of landscapes reveal how physical form (the built environment) is driven by culture as well as reveal the effects resultant form has on inhabitants.
  Resource exploitation, racial segregation, materially obsessed capitalist cultures all become self-fulfilling prophecies the built form steering culture in a hidden landscape psycholgy.

<p>l am still a beginner to photography, learning to understand the basics of exposure aperture and lens selection. Most of the time I shoot manully as it forces me to think about exposure and depth of field making intuitive. Some of my inspirations are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Evans">Walker Evans</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Capa">Robert Capa</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Arbus">Diane Arbus</a> and <a href="https://www.williamalbertallard.com/">William Allard</a>.

<strong>Equipment</strong> 
 <p>I use the Fuji XPro and <a href="https://www.fujifilmusa.com/products/digital_cameras/x-lenses/">their fixed x series lenses- 16/23/35/56</a> Fuji’s system is small weatherproof and very durable. It's sensor captures a gorgeous spectrum of color.  
   Summers I work as a mountain guide in the San Juan mountains of Colorado between 10 and 14 thousand feet in elevation so my camera must fit in a backpack, be lightweight and work in any weather condition. Also critical the Fuji system is very usable by horse.
Digitally I keep things minimal using an iPad pro, editing kept to a minimum with Lightroom. With the iPad I've found I can use open source software, Jekyll and Github to maintain this page. The core idea is be mobile and self reliant, not needing electricity except what a backpack based solar unit can provide and avoid the use of a laptop or desktop. If I can't do all I need to do on the hood of my truck or trail then it doesnt work.

<strong>Recent</strong>
  <p>In 2016 I filmed several interviews in <a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/no-mans-land-trailer-yuftvd/">“No Man’s Land”</a> a documentary about the armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon to protest a ranching family’s incarceration. The film was nominated for the Best Documentary at the Denver International Film Festival 2017, and nominated Best Documentary Feature at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2017. It was awarded the Best Documentary Film at the Gasparilla International Film Festival in 2018. 
    
<p>In 2014 Awarded the Zilphea Horton Grant by the <a href="https://www.highlandercenter.org">Highlander Foundation</a>. 
  This was used to research and <a href="https://medium.com/@jonbcarroll/leaked-documents-reveal-dothan-police-department-alleged-to-have-planted-drugs-f89109dc196e"> document victims</a> in a community ranked by Harvard's Center for Government Ethics as one of the most corrupt in the nation - Alabama’s 20th judicial district. A book of these photographs, “Save the Kennys” is forthcoming.

<p>My research interest is primarily documenting cultural landscapes, the resultant culure they form and how that specifically influences culture and creates myth.
