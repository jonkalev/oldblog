 <p><strong>2019</strong>(in progress)&nbsp;<strong> MAELSTROM </strong> &nbsp;. In the summer of 1999 two high school seniors, one on her seventeenth birthday, were brutally murdered execution style and left in downtown Ozark Alabama. For over 20 years the case remained unsolved fueling rumours and conspiracy theories of a police cover-up. In 2017 a police officer came forward and claimed a officer was responsible. The Attorney General then appointed a special cold case investigator and a retired state law enfocement offical that had quietly worked the case for years shared documents that was never shared with the FBI that are part of the exhibit. 
 <P>In 2019 an arrest was made of a local pastor who's DNA matched semen found on one of the girl, however there was no evidence of rape only consensual sex. Part photo exhibit and part a series of short filmed interviews this work examines the emotional trauma unsolved murders can have on a small town. It is a rare glimpse behind the scenes at an invesigation and the  potential cover-up of the murders over a 20 year timeframe.

<p><strong> 2017&nbsp; NO MANS LAND </strong>&nbsp;This was my first opportunity to film part of a documentary. Directed by David Byars, No Mans Land is an on-the-ground account of the 2016 standoff between protestors of a ranching family's conflict over grazing rights and the occupation of Oregon's Malheur National Wildlife Refuge and federal authorities during a 41-day siege. It documents the occupation from inception to demise and tells the story of those on the inside of this movement. Watch the trailer below.

PBS' Independent Lens recently aired a special "Return to Malheur" that contains previously unpublished footage and is valuable in understanding the continued conflict over grazing rights on public land.

 <p><strong> 2012&nbsp; DOWN IN DIXIE </strong> &nbsp;.This work served as my graduate thesis at Auburn Univertisty and examines how the physical form of landscape in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Belt_(region_of_Alabama">the Black Belt region of Alabama</a></em> reinforces racism. It is my assertion this landscape creates a negative value of "civic equality‚Äù, where and how racial conflict occurs was documented by video, photographs and drawings. Communities are segregated according to race, civic space often anchored by confederate monuments and compositions of towns deny one race economic participation.  The research reveals two different psychological spaces emerge from a singular landscape. This dynamic reinforces racism and acceptance of segregation being a hidden transcript contributing to racial conflict.

<p> The thesis is published at the Auburn Univeristy library. 
 Thesis committee was Professor of Architecture Michael Robinson and Chair of the Landscape Architecture program Jack Williams.
