<p><strong> 2017&nbsp; NO MANS LAND </strong>&nbsp;This was my first opportunity to film part of a documentary. Directed by David Byars, No Mans Land is an on-the-ground account of the 2016 standoff between protestors of a ranching family's conflict over grazing rights and the occupation of Oregon's Malheur National Wildlife Refuge and federal authorities during a 41-day siege. It documents the occupation from inception to demise and tells the story of those on the inside of this movement. Watch the trailer below.

PBS' Independent Lens recently aired a special titled "Return to Malheur" that contains previously unpublished footage and is valuable in understanding the continued conflict over grazing rights on public land.
